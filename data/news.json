Beef exports are forecasted to increase by 5% to 3.2 million metric tons, while imports may rise by 2% to 3.1 million metric tons.\n\nRetail beef prices are predicted to increase by 6% to $6.80 per pound. Feeder cattle prices could climb 12% to $175 per cwt, while fed cattle prices may jump 10% to $145 per cwt. Cow-calf producers are anticipated to see a 9% rise in their returns, reaching $1,000 per head.\n\nThe changes are driven by factors like declining cattle inventory, growing global demand, and limited supply. Experts recommend that farmers closely monitor market trends, consider diversification, and adapt their operations to stay competitive in the evolving beef and cattle industry.",

Warm-season perennials may not work well for a July reseeding, but summer annuals like sudangrass, sorghum-sudangrass, pearl millet, and teff grass can be good options.\n- For August/September reseedings, oats, triticale, and annual ryegrass are recommended to graze or harvest in the spring.\n- Grasses and legumes each provide different benefits - grasses reduce erosion while legumes add nitrogen and can increase carrying capacity, but must be balanced to avoid issues like grass tetany or bloat.\n- Key preparation steps include soil testing/amendments, weed control, using high-quality seed, inoculating legumes, suppressing existing vegetation, calibrating equipment, and planting the best crop for the timing.\n- Farmers should leverage resources and have conversations to develop a thorough plan for dealing with unscheduled pipeline easement work.",

He is looking to return to action towards the end of June, aiming to compete at the Reno Rodeo.\n\nFrost, a 21-year-old from Browns Valley, California, had an operation on January 28th to reattach the labrum in his left shoulder that was damaged during the recent NFR. He placed in just one round at the NFR and finished 13th in the PRCA | Bill Fick Ford World Standings. \n\nBoth cowboys are hoping to be back competing by late June. Their injuries had been significantly impacting their performances, with Shadbolt saying he had been riding with discomfort for over a year and Frost losing power and ability to stay square due to the shoulder issue.\n\nThe article includes quotes from both Shadbolt and Frost describing their injuries and surgery details. It also mentions the doctors who performed the procedures - Dr. J.W. Thomas Byrd in Nashville for Shadbolt, and Dr. Travis Kieckbusch in Reno for Frost.",

The RFP aims to support projects that enhance prevention, preparedness, mitigation, and response capabilities for the swine industry. \n\nKey details:\n- Proposals are due by January 18, 2023.\n- Up to $750,000 in total funding is available.\n- Projects should focus on one or more of these areas: biosecurity, surveillance, diagnostics, disease modeling, or response planning.\n- Eligible applicants include universities, research institutions, and private companies.\n\nThe recent outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has raised concerns about the potential for the virus to spread to pigs. Swine can act as \"mixing vessels\" where avian and human influenza strains can combine, leading to the emergence of new pandemic threats. Protecting the U.S. swine herd is crucial to safeguarding both animal and public health.\n\nThis RFP follows an earlier $500,000 funding announcement in October 2022 for similar research projects. The goal is to build on past work and further strengthen the swine industry's preparedness and response capabilities against the H5N1 risk.",

Beth Richardson, Canada's consul general in Minneapolis, stated that if the USMCA is renewed for 16 more years, it would provide the much-needed predictability for businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nThe three countries combined account for around $1.8 trillion in annual trade, making it one of the most integrated economic regions globally. Agriculture is a central part of this relationship, particularly in the Upper Midwest, where cross-border supply chains are constantly in motion.\n\nAndrea Vaubel, the deputy commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, emphasized the importance of stability, noting the state's position as a major producer of livestock, grain, and specialty crops. Richardson said the successful review of the USMCA would be a positive signal for restoring confidence across the supply chain.\n\nThe article also highlighted the impact of tariff uncertainty, such as the briefly imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports of steel and aluminum last February, which affected the affordability of potash, a critical fertilizer for farmers. Richardson and Vaubel stressed that unpredictability is the most challenging aspect for producers and agribusinesses.\n\nAlejandra Bologna, the head consul of Mexico in St. Paul, stated that 85% of the goods traded between Mexico and the U.S. are under the USMCA treatment and are not affected by tariffs. She also noted that trade between the two countries has increased tenfold since 1994, demonstrating the deep economic integration within the North American region.\n\nThe article provided examples of the integration, such as Canada supplying over 90% of the oats used by U.S. food processing facilities, and the U.S. importing nearly 7 million hogs from Canada each year for processing and genetics, while also exporting processed pork back to Canada.\n\nOverall, the key takeaways are the importance of trade predictability, the need to avoid tariff uncertainty, the deep economic integration within the North American region, and the mutually dependent agricultural relationship between Canada and Minnesota.",

      "summary": "S. beef herd, with Texas, the nation's largest beef-producing state, seeing a decline of about 30,000 cows. However, Texas producers held back 50,000 more heifers, an 8% increase in replacements that could indicate the early stages of a gradual herd rebuild.\n\nNationally, beef cow numbers dropped just over 1%, a sharper decline than expected. Experts anticipate a slower cattle herd rebuild and tighter cattle supplies will continue to impact the industry from cow-calf operations to feedlots, packers, and grocery stores. \n\nHigh calf prices and concerns over a rapid herd rebuild and subsequent price drops are causing some ranchers to prioritize short-term returns by selling bred heifers rather than holding them back for herd growth. Bred heifer values have reached $4,000-$5,000.\n\nTexas' long-term cattle capacity has also been impacted by urban expansion, land fragmentation, and conversion of pasture to non-agricultural uses. Emerging drought is another factor that could influence producer decisions.\n\nExperts expect calf prices could climb even higher in 2026-2027 due to the tightened supplies, with 500-600 lb steers currently averaging $450/cwt in Texas compared to $326/cwt last year. Cow-calf producer margins should remain strong, supported by lower feed costs and sustained demand.\n\nHowever, the outlook for Texas will depend heavily on how the drought situation evolves in the state. Recent winter storms brought snow, ice, and freezing temperatures, causing challenges for livestock producers with some calf losses reported. Wheat and oat crops were also impacted.",

This news was welcomed by the biofuels and soybean industry.\n\nThe 45Z program, created under President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and amended last year under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, gives soybean oil a better standing with a higher credit, going from 30 cents per gallon to 60 cents per gallon.\n\nTom Verry, the director of outreach and development for Clean Fuels Alliance America, stated that the guidance will kickstart an industry that has been in a state of limbo for the last year. The tax credit is projected to result in a record use of 15.5 billion pounds of soybean oil in biofuels this year, more than half of U.S. production.\n\nScott Metzger, the American Soybean Association (ASA) President and Ohio farmer, expressed excitement about the credit news, stating that it will help build domestic markets for U.S. soybeans. Steve Censky, the ASA CEO, also noted that the credit news should be paired with finalizing the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) blending targets to complement the work of the Treasury and Congress.\n\nThe clean fuel production credit provides businesses an income tax credit for clean transportation fuel produced domestically after December 31, 2024, and sold by December 31, 2029. The guidance also proposes rules to implement certain changes to the credit brought on by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",

      "summary": "The system captures water from subsurface tile drains during wet periods, stores it in a pond, and then reuses it for irrigation during drought. This was part of a pilot project with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.\n\nThe Blairs' system stores water in a pond and pumps it through an irrigation pivot on 125 acres. While recent rains have limited their ability to test the full impact, Iowa State data has shown yield increases from the system. Experts like Chris Hay of Hay Water Solutions say the system can provide a 3-inch supplemental water supply during dry summer periods.\n\nAn economic analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund found drainage water recycling can boost crop yield income by $130-$146 per acre annually, while saving $10-$20 per acre in operating costs. The practice also provides water quality benefits by reducing nutrient runoff.\n\nHowever, these systems require a significant upfront investment of $2-$3 million, plus ongoing maintenance. Experts recommend having a pond that can store 4-6 inches of water for the irrigated area. Funding will likely require both private farmer investment and public/outside support.\n\nThe Blairs advise other farmers interested in this to seek local help and expertise to plan and implement the system. They are now looking to add features like a fertilizer injection system to further optimize the setup.",
