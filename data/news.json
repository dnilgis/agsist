      "summary": "Frost seeding can be a cost-effective way to revitalize a diminishing stand or introduce legumes to an existing forage stand. However, it is not recommended for grass species.\n\nThe success of frost seeding depends on assessing the condition of the existing stand and seeding at the proper time. Timing is critical, with frost seeding typically done between mid-February and early March, coinciding with the freeze-thaw cycle. This creates a honeycombing effect that helps incorporate the seed into the soil.\n\nA thick thatch can pose a challenge, so it's recommended to closely hay or overgraze the area in the fall or winter prior to frost seeding to open the canopy. Ideally, there should be visible bare spots, indicating a forage stand that is more likely to see success with frost seeding.\n\nSoil type can also influence success. Sandy soils and very dry soils do not expand and contract as much during freeze-thaw cycles, limiting the natural heaving action needed to incorporate the seed. Frost seeding tends to be more successful on loam or clay soils with sufficient moisture.\n\nThe fate of frost-seeded stands heavily depends on spring moisture levels, as adequate moisture is vital for establishing a healthy stand. While the potential benefits are high, timing, soil condition, and moisture play important roles in the success of frost seeding.\n\nThe article was written by Shelby Gruss, an assistant professor and forage extension specialist who joined the Iowa State University Department of Agronomy in November 2023.

They allegedly lured investors, ranchers, and others in the cattle industry with false promises about purchasing and raising cattle, when in reality they misused the funds for personal expenses and to pay off earlier investors.\n\nOne of the defendants, Joshua Link, is currently a fugitive being sought by the FBI. The U.S. Attorney stated that thousands of victims nationwide were defrauded by the multi-million dollar scheme, and that the defendants will be held accountable.\n\nThe indictment alleges the fraud occurred from January 2021 through December 2023. Specific misused funds included over $63,000 wired for a \"Home Payoff\" and over $527,000 wired to purchase real estate.\n\nThe FBI is asking the public to contact them if they have any information about the location of the fugitive Joshua Link.",

Drumgoon Dairy, a 6,500-head dairy operation in Eastern South Dakota, lost over half of its workforce when the U.S. Department of Homeland Security deported its Hispanic workers about 9 months ago. This left the remaining 12 employees working around the clock.\n\n3. South Dakota has actively courted large-scale dairy operations through tax incentives, streamlined permitting, and financial aid for infrastructure. For example, the state granted Warner-based Silverstreak Dairies up to $12 million in November 2025 to develop manure containment systems as they plan to double their herd to 5,400 cows.\n\n4. The labor shortage issue is exacerbated by the fact that Americans are typically unwilling to take on these demanding dairy jobs, according to Rick Naerebout of the Idaho Dairymen's Association.\n\n5. Andy Larson, a dairy farmer in Beresford, South Dakota, argues that the labor shortage is not due to a lack of willingness, but rather low pay. He says the 1980s farm crisis led many farm families to discourage the next generation from returning to farming.\n\n6. Small dairy farms in South Dakota are struggling with low milk prices and limited access to processing facilities, making it difficult for them to \"make it work\" in the current market.\n\n7. The article highlights the urgent need for immigration reform to address the labor shortage in the dairy industry, as well as the challenges faced by both large and small dairy operations in the state.",

Beef prices are hovering near record highs due to strong demand and reduced supply, as the U.S. cattle herd has dropped to the lowest level in nearly 75 years due to persistent drought and a halt on U.S. imports of Mexican cattle.\n\nU.S. beef packers have been losing money as tight supplies of cattle have forced them to pay more for the livestock they slaughter and process. The closure of the Cargill plant in Milwaukee will further impact beef supply and processing capacity in the region.",

Sleighs ranged from simple work sleighs to fancy Albany and Portland cutters with decorative brass fittings and paint.\n\nSleighing required accessories like buggy robes (often made from animal hides), heavy gloves, and foot warmers (tin boxes with hot coals or stoneware with hot water). Snow knockers - blacksmith-made iron hammers - were used to remove ice and snow from horses' hooves. Sleigh bells alerted others to an approaching sleigh.\n\nSleighing also involved nighttime torchlight caravans to neighboring towns for parties around a bonfire, allowing residents to socialize and build community. This winter sleighing culture contrasts sharply with modern Ohioans' disdain for snow and investment in snow-fighting equipment.",

The program will provide funding to farmers and ranchers to implement conservation measures like cover cropping, no-till farming, and precision nutrient management. The goal is to help farmers reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build soil health.\n\nThe USDA will begin accepting applications for the program on March 1, 2026, and the deadline to apply is May 31, 2026. Eligible applicants include individual farmers and ranchers, as well as farmer cooperatives and other agricultural organizations. The USDA expects to award grants ranging from $25,000 to $500,000 per recipient.\n\nThe new grant program is part of the Biden administration's broader effort to address climate change in the agriculture sector. According to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, \"This investment will help farmers and ranchers lead the way in adopting practices that reduce emissions, increase carbon sequestration, and build resilience on their operations.\"\n\nExperts say the program could have significant impacts for farmers, helping them save money on inputs, improve soil health, and potentially earn additional income from carbon credits. Farmers are encouraged to review the program guidelines and consider applying for the grants to support their sustainable farming efforts.",

Frost heaving will create uneven soil surface and lifted plant crowns.\n\n- Damage from frost heaving can be deceptive as plants may green up initially but then die once upper soil moisture is depleted.\n\n- Identifying damaged areas early is important to plan management activities like interseeding to aid pasture recovery.\n\n- Expert quoted is Emma Matcham, assistant professor at Ohio State University's Horticulture and Crop Science Department.",

Farmer Eli Mack has incorporated more trees on his 50-head beef cattle operation, Mack Farms, in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. Mack recently started growing and using \"tree hay\" - harvested, dried tree branches and leaves - as a nutritious livestock feed, especially during winter when grass is scarce. Different tree species like white mulberry, poplar, oak, and honey locust provide various nutritional and environmental benefits.\n\nWhile agroforestry was long overlooked, it is becoming more accepted today. Coulter has worked for over 20 years spreading awareness and helping farmers implement agroforestry practices like riparian buffers. Her work has protected water, built soil, and supported biodiversity. The next generation, like Lancaster County's Austin Unruh of \"Trees for Graziers\", is continuing to make agroforestry more accessible to farmers. Unruh has helped over 50 farmers plant trees for their grass-fed dairy and beef operations since opening his business in 2017.",

Restoring pollinator habitat on agricultural landscapes is important, and can be done cost-effectively. Planting a diverse mix of flowering plants, even in small areas, can support a variety of bee species.\n\n4. Research shows that the amount of surrounding agricultural land or size of the habitat area does not significantly impact bee diversity and abundance, as long as there are sufficient floral resources.\n\n5. Integrating pollinator habitat into croplands can have benefits for natural pest control, and can even improve yields for self-pollinating crops like soybeans.\n\n6. Funding sources and conservation programs may be available to assist farmers in establishing and maintaining pollinator habitat.\n\n7. Minnesota alone has around 525 species of bees, ranging from tiny to large bumblebees.

The true indicator of content effectiveness is now attention time - how long a user spends meaningfully engaged with the content.\n\nAgWeb.com recently underwent a redesign to increase user attention and engagement. The results show:\n- 54% increase in readers reaching 75% of an article\n- 21% increase in readers reaching 90% of an article\n- 33% increase in daily article pageviews per mobile user\n\nThe article cites data that 79% of online users scan content rather than reading word-for-word, and most only absorb around 28% of page text. AgWeb's redesign aimed to simplify layouts and guide deeper engagement.\n\nAttention time is a better metric than CTR because it shows if users stayed with the content, scrolled with purpose, consumed multiple articles, and were in an active, focused mindset. High-attention environments deliver stronger results for advertisers, as their brand is present during engaged moments.\n\nThe improvements on AgWeb are said to directly translate to more value for brands, providing more time with content, more content consumed per session, higher quality impressions, and better alignment with how farmers search today. The article concludes that attention, not just clicks, should be the priority metric for ag marketers.",

Cabbages, including Napa cabbage and 'Carex' cabbage, handle cold well and offer a variety of options. Spinach, like 'Avon' and 'Space' varieties, are resistant to mildew and bolting. Onions, especially bulbing onions, benefit from the long maturation period that winter sowing provides.\n\nPerennial flowers are also excellent candidates for winter sowing, as many need cold stratification to break dormancy. Good options include pansies, echinacea, snapdragons, larkspur, and scabiosa. These flowers can provide natural pest control and attract beneficial insects to the farm.\n\nWinter sowing allows farmers to get a head start on the growing season and produce hardier, earlier-maturing plants. This method reduces risk compared to direct sowing while offering the same benefits. By choosing the right flowers and vegetables, farmers can maximize their profits and productivity come spring.",

The article recommends closely assessing fields for plant loss and patterns before deciding whether to replant.\n\nAn additional resource is provided for more information on soybean replant decisions.",
