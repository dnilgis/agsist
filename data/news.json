      "summary": "Over 80% of the world's flowering plants rely on pollinators to reproduce, and pollinators provide an estimated $200 billion in ecological services annually.\n\nThere are around 20,000 species of bees globally, with over 500 species found in Minnesota alone. Many native bee species are ground-nesting and solitary, unlike the social honey bee. Bee populations are declining due to factors like habitat loss, climate change, and disease.\n\nRestoring pollinator habitat on agricultural landscapes is critical. Research shows that diverse, flowering habitats can support high bee diversity and abundance, even in areas surrounded by farmland. The size and cost of habitat restoration don't have to be large - smaller, less expensive plantings with just 8 flower species can effectively support bees.\n\nPollinator habitats don't increase pest problems in adjacent crop fields, and can actually boost yields of self-pollinating crops like soybeans by up to 20% through improved pollination. Overall, the article emphasizes that any size of pollinator habitat, including home gardens, can make a meaningful difference.\n\nThe article cites research from the University of Minnesota Bee Lab and other sources. It includes comments from Dr. Dan Cariveau, an Associate Professor at the Bee Lab. The article was published on February 9, 2026.",

      "summary": "Smart sprayer technology is transforming agriculture by boosting efficiency and precision in pesticide and fertilizer application. These advanced systems use automation, sensors, and precision control to reduce waste and improve accuracy. \n\nKey benefits include up to 50% reduction in chemical use, 30% improvement in spray deposition, and 20% reduction in application time. Some smart sprayers can adjust application rates automatically based on plant size, reducing over-spraying.\n\nLeading manufacturers include John Deere, AGCO, and Raven Industries. Their smart sprayer models cost $50,000-$100,000. Subsidies and rebates are available through the USDA's EQIP program to help farmers adopt this technology.\n\nPrecision application reduces environmental impact and chemical runoff. It also saves farmers money on input costs. Experts predict smart sprayers will become standard within 5-10 years as more farmers prioritize sustainability and efficiency.",

      "summary": "Madalyn Shires, SDSU Extension Plant Pathology Specialist, presented information on this at the Sioux Falls Farm Show on January 30, 2026.\n\nIn corn, wind-blown diseases like tar spot and southern rust have seen a significant increase. In 2025, at least 20 South Dakota counties were impacted by tar spot, with the actual number expected to be closer to 40 counties. Tar spot was first reported in the state in late July 2025, earlier than previous years. Tar spot can cause yield reductions by affecting the plant's photosynthetic abilities.\n\nSouthern rust, which typically arrives late in the growing season, has also been showing up earlier in 2024 and 2025, causing yield losses for producers. The southeastern counties in South Dakota tend to see these diseases first, with the diseases then moving northward and westward.\n\nIn soybeans, the soybean cyst nematode has been a major threat, now documented in 49 of the state's counties - a significant increase. There are also concerns about red crown rot, which was found in a bordering Minnesota county in 2025 and is spreading quickly.\n\nManagement recommendations include knowing the crop growth stage vulnerable to diseases, using effective fungicides, rotating resistance genes, and implementing long rotation cycles to manage nematodes. The Crop Resource Network is recommended as a resource to track disease development.\n\nShires noted that weather conditions will impact disease pressures, with wet springs potentially leading to more bacterial and viral diseases, and drier/warmer/more humid summers potentially increasing southern rust and tar spot.",

In 1952, he was a member of the winning Texas A&M Junior Poultry Judging Team and the highest-scoring individual on the Senior National Poultry Judging Contest team.\n\nThe Huffmans' support for poultry science at Texas A&M extends beyond the renamed complex. In 2020, they established the Barbara J. Huffman and William M. \"Bill\" Huffman '53 Chair in Poultry Science, and they have also donated funds for a trophy case in the Kleberg Animal and Food Sciences Center. Additionally, the Huffmans have supported various other programs and initiatives at Texas A&M.\n\nAccording to Audrey McElroy, Ph.D., professor and head of the Department of Poultry Science, the Huffmans' \"visionary support reflects a deep belief in the power of poultry science to prepare students, advance discovery and serve the industries that feed the world.\" The renaming of the complex is a testament to the Huffmans' commitment and a means to ensure the continued leadership of Texas A&M in advancing poultry science and supporting the industries that depend on it.",

Experts expect more sporadic cases to occur through the spring.\n\nWhile the risk to humans remains low, with only 71 human cases and 2 deaths reported nationwide as of January 26th, the virus can infect a wide range of animals beyond poultry.\n\nTo protect backyard flocks, experts recommend strict biosecurity measures like limiting exposure to areas frequented by wild waterfowl, disinfecting equipment, and isolating new birds. There is no treatment for infected birds, so producers should contact authorities if they suspect avian influenza.\n\nThe commercial poultry supply chain is regularly tested, and standard cooking protocols can kill the virus. However, major outbreaks in commercial facilities can still disrupt production and lead to higher grocery prices.\n\nFederal and state agencies will continue monitoring the spread of avian influenza, which typically subsides in the summer but has shown a tendency to resurge in the fall, winter, and spring since 2022.",

The true indicator of content effectiveness is now attention time - how long a user spends meaningfully engaged with the content.\n\nAgWeb.com, a Farm Journal website, recently underwent a redesign to increase user engagement and attention time:\n- 54% increase in readers reaching 75% of an article\n- 21% increase in readers reaching 90% of an article\n- 33% increase in daily article pageviews per mobile user\n\nThe article cites that in general, only 16% of users read every word of online content, while 79% scan pages rather than reading fully. AgWeb's redesign aimed to simplify layouts and guide deeper engagement.\n\nAttention time is a clearer indicator of impact than click-through rate, as it shows if users stayed with the content, scrolled with purpose, consumed multiple articles, and were in an active, focused mindset. High-attention environments deliver stronger results for advertisers, as their brand is present during engaged moments.\n\nThe improvements on AgWeb translate to more value for brands, providing more time with content, increased exposure opportunities, and higher quality impressions. This aligns with how farmers search and consume content today. For ag marketers, AgWeb's optimized content and design offers one of the most effective digital environments, as better attention leads to better outcomes.",

      "summary": "The systems tested were: conventional tillage (CT), strip-tillage (ST), no-tillage (NT), and no-tillage with a cereal rye cover crop (NT+CR). Each system was paired with 3 starter fertilizer strategies: unfertilized control, 15 lb N/ac, and 15 lb N/ac + 10 lb S/ac.\n\nEarly soybean growth showed a response to starter fertilizer, with 12% higher biomass at the V4 stage. However, by the R2 stage, leaf tissue N and S levels were sufficient across all treatments, indicating the soybeans could meet their nutrient needs through biological fixation and soil organic matter. \n\nSoybean yields ranged from 60-95 bu/ac across the sites. Starter fertilizer did not significantly increase yields. Yields were similar across tillage systems, with CT/ST averaging 78.4 bu/ac, NT 77.6 bu/ac, and NT+CR 76.2 bu/ac.\n\nWhen factoring in costs, NT had the highest partial net return, followed by ST and CT. NT+CR had the lowest partial net return due to higher cover crop management costs of $55/ac, though this can be offset by conservation program cost-share.\n\nThe trials will continue in 2026 to track medium-term effects on soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics in these conservation systems. This will provide valuable insights to help farmers adopt conservation practices without sacrificing yield.",

Good crops to grow in a greenhouse in February include tomatoes, peppers, brassicas (kale, cabbage, cauliflower), lettuces, potatoes, onions, and various flowers.\n\n4. Greenhouse growing helps provide a head start on the growing season, protects plants from pests and diseases, and allows for growing cool-weather crops like brassicas and lettuces even in frost-free areas.\n\n5. Key factors to consider are maintaining consistent warmth (50°F or higher), moisture, and light for optimal growth of seedlings and transplants.\n\n6. Greenhouses with more advanced features like heating, ventilation, and climate control allow for year-round growing of a wider range of crops.",

Plant prairie strips - Devoting 10-25% of farmland to prairie strips can boost yields, improve soil nutrients, and attract beneficial predators and pollinators. The diverse plants and flowers support a healthy above and below-ground ecosystem.\n\n2. Reduce tilling and use cover crops - Minimizing tillage and planting cover crops instead improves soil structure and increases insect biodiversity. This supports more animal species on the land.\n\n3. Practice regenerative grazing - Using a rotational grazing model and planting native grasses/forbs instead of non-native forage can boost biodiversity in grazing areas, especially when combined with techniques like prescribed burning and silvopasture.\n\n4. Implement Integrated Pest Management (IPM) - Attracting beneficial insects through diverse plantings and cultural pest control methods reduces the need for harmful pesticides that damage biodiversity.\n\n5. Establish conservation easements - Partnering with land trusts to protect farmland can provide more habitat for local species while also offering tax benefits to landowners.\n\nAdopting these strategies, even partially, can help farmers work in harmony with the natural world around them, supporting species diversity and overall farm health. Experts emphasize that these practices, while sometimes requiring more effort upfront, ultimately lead to more sustainable and productive agricultural systems.",

      "summary": "Purdue researchers adopt interdisciplinary approach to assessing emerging tar spot disease in corn:\n\n- Tar spot fungal disease has been endemic in Latin American countries since 1904 but was not detected in the U.S. prior to 2015. Since then, it has spread to 16 states and Ontario, Canada by 2022.\n\n- Purdue researchers, led by C.D. Cruz, are using a mix of statistical, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, AI, and computer vision methods to better understand the dynamics of tar spot in corn. Their work is funded by two USDA grants totaling nearly $1.1 million.\n\n- In previous efforts, the researchers developed a digital method (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn, which they tested against human raters. They are now refining the training methods to improve the model's accuracy.\n\n- The research team also includes Purdue's Mohammad Jahanshahi, who has adapted his AI and computer-vision approaches to inspecting and analyzing civil infrastructure damage for agriculture.\n\n- Graduate students Mariela Fernández-Campos and Abhishek Subedi are finalizing a proof-of-concept data fusion project, integrating drone imagery and weather data to capture details about the tar spot pathosystem.\n\n- Another parallel task is to quantify and model tar spot epidemics in production-style fields, using disease observations and drone-based imagery.\n\n- The interdisciplinary approach aims to quantify and model tar spot severity by referencing and integrating imagery with spatial and temporal data.",
