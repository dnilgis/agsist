      "summary": "Rosenberg argues that the American industrial food system is an asset rather than a liability. It was released in February 2026.\n\nThe authors believe the current industrial food system provides more nutritious, varied, fresh, and affordable options than ever before. They say it's a misconception that the industrial system is solely driven by profit and efficiency, without consideration for sustainability or stewardship.\n\nRosenberg, an associate professor at Duke University, has expertise in rural history and the history of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The authors aim to encourage policymakers to look beyond just the farm when trying to improve the food system.\n\nThe authors define \"industrial\" food as being scalable and standardized in inputs and outputs, rather than relying on alternative methods like organic or local production. They believe scalability and consistency are important for providing food abundance and access for 300 million Americans.\n\nWhile the authors don't dismiss the value of some organic or regenerative practices, they argue that an overemphasis on these ideological labels can divert from practical, outcome-driven solutions. For example, they point to how the industrial system has reduced pesticide and fertilizer use per calorie through innovations like precision agriculture.\n\nThe key is continuing to apply smart innovations and common-sense policies to further improve the industrial food system, rather than automatically favoring small-scale, local alternatives, according to the authors.",

Critics warn it will raise consumer food prices.\n\n- The bills have passed the House and are now being considered by the Senate. This is the third time the legislation has been introduced, but the first time it may not face a veto.\n\n- Key sponsors are Del. Adele McClure and Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy. Critics include Del. Wendell Walker.\n\n- Small farmers reportedly support the bill, saying they already pay over $15/hour to attract workers they depend on.

Spinach - An easy cold-season ground cover that increases good soil bacteria and fungi. Especially beneficial for pepper crops later on. Requires soil temperature of at least 40°F (4°C).\n\n2. Kale - A multipurpose crop that feeds the soil, farmer, customers, and livestock. Kale needs slightly warmer soil of at least 45°F (7°C). Resistant varieties are recommended in disease-prone areas.\n\n3. Daikon radish - Deep taproots break up compacted soil and scrounge up leftover nitrogen. Requires soil temperature of at least 65°F (18°C).\n\n4. Oats - Grow quickly to cover soil and prevent weed growth. Form beneficial relationships with fungi. Sow at a rate of 4-6 oz per 100 sq ft. Can be terminated without harvesting oats.\n\n5. Buckwheat - A quick-maturing crop that conditions poor soil. Attracts pollinators and beneficial insects. Can be used as an organic mulch after termination.\n\nThese cover crops should be planted before spring crops, as they boost the subsequent yields. Farmers can use low tunnels to add warmth and protection in colder climates.",

Taiwan agreed to purchase an estimated $4 billion in U.S. agricultural products annually over the next four years, representing a 40% increase from previous levels. Key beneficiaries include U.S. corn and soybean farmers, who will see increased exports of 4 million metric tons and 1.5 million metric tons respectively. The deal also provides access for U.S. beef and pork, with Taiwan agreeing to lift bans on ractopamine, a feed additive used in American livestock. Additionally, the agreement streamlines regulatory processes and reduces tariffs on many U.S. farm goods. Experts estimate this trade deal could add $1 billion in annual sales for U.S. agricultural producers. The agreement is seen as a significant win for American farmers amidst ongoing trade tensions with China.",

Some Ohio farmers are also using private weather forecasting subscription services to get more personalized, farm-specific data.\n\nDuane Stateler, a crop and hog farmer in northwestern Ohio, has used a private weather forecasting service for 14 years. His service, BAMwx.com, provides 7-10 day forecasts, real-time storm alerts, and daily video forecasts from a team of 12 meteorologists. Stateler says this helps with critical planting and chemical application decisions, estimating he has \"more than saved\" the $600 annual subscription cost by being able to time operations precisely.\n\nThe article notes that other agricultural forecasting tools are also emerging, such as Ranchbot for pasture management, and companies like Tempest and DTN using public data and machine learning to deliver hyper-local forecasts. \n\nOhio State Extension plans to install mesonet weather stations in all 88 counties by 2025, providing public data to improve disease/pest scouting alerts, crop modeling, and temperature monitoring for farmers.\n\nAaron Wilson, an OSU Extension climate specialist, says short-term forecasting is most reliable 3-5 days out, so denser data networks are key to increasing accuracy for agricultural needs like planting windows and drought monitoring.",

This theme was at the center of the Land Stewardship Project's Jan. 27 winter workshop, \"Beyond Exports: Rebuilding Local Markets,\" where farmers, organizers and rural leaders discussed the limits of an export-driven commodity system and the need for new markets closer to home.\n\nFor Landon Plagge, the 2025 Iowa Leopold Conservation Award winner, the answer was moving beyond the farm gate and further down the supply chain. \"Farmers taking back power is an interesting question for us,\" Plagge said during the workshop. \"It means moving down the supply chain, getting more dollars coming into our farms and coming back into our communities.\"",

Brown encouraged farmers to reduce land and equipment costs, noting Brazil's cost-effective equipment utilization.\n\nCrop producers are facing high input costs, with land rents, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed costs continuing to increase even during low profit margins. There has also been uncertainty around trade agreements and tariffs.\n\nBrown provided an economic outlook, projecting flat disposable income for the next few years, a gradual decline in global economic development due to increased tariffs, and slowing growth in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel without further policy changes.\n\nHowever, the specialist sees potential for improved crop prices in 2026, with USDA estimates of a 4% increase in soybean prices, 10% in corn, 13% in wheat, and 4% increases in canola, barley and cattle. This is due to increasing demand, policy changes, and the potential for smaller crops.\n\nDespite the price increases, Brown said many of these prices still may not cover the cost of production. He encouraged farmers to think intentionally about remaining flexible in their marketing plans and operations to capture potential price spikes.",

Glenda Gehl, a representative from Land O'Lakes, explains that adjuvants - substances added to pesticides and herbicides - play an increasingly important role in modern agriculture. \n\nAdjuvants can improve spray coverage, droplet size, and penetration, leading to more effective and efficient pesticide and herbicide applications. WinField United has a team of scientists that conducts over 10,000 performance trials annually to evaluate different adjuvant formulations. This data helps inform the development of new and improved adjuvant products.\n\nOne new adjuvant, Unite, was recently introduced by WinField United. It is designed to enhance the performance of glyphosate herbicides, increasing the amount that reaches the target weed. Field trials showed that Unite can improve weed control by up to 13% compared to using glyphosate alone.\n\nGehl emphasizes that selecting the right adjuvant is crucial for farmers to get the most out of their pesticide and herbicide applications. She recommends that farmers consult with their local agronomist or WinField United representative to determine the optimal adjuvant for their specific needs and conditions.",

      "summary": "The U.S. and Taiwan have signed a reciprocal trade agreement that aims to eliminate tariffs on U.S. dairy products and reduce non-tariff barriers to dairy exports. \n\nThe agreement is seen as a major boost for U.S. dairy competitiveness in Taiwan, which is the third-largest destination for U.S. fluid milk exports. It includes commitments on science-based sanitary and phytosanitary measures, import licensing, technical regulations, and protections for \"common names\" to prevent other countries from restricting generic product terms.\n\nIndustry groups like the National Milk Producers Federation, U.S. Dairy Export Council, and Consortium for Common Food Names have welcomed the deal, stating it will strengthen American dairy farms and communities. They plan to work closely with U.S. and Taiwanese officials on swift implementation.\n\nThe agreement was signed by Ambassador Jamieson Greer, representing the U.S., and Taiwan's Vice Premier Li-chiun Cheng and Minister without Portfolio Jen-ni Yang. It is part of President Trump's efforts to advance economic and national security interests in the Asia-Pacific region.",

Slow-growing herbs like basil, oregano, and rosemary should be planted in February to ensure mature transplants.\n3. Tomatoes should be started indoors in February, especially for growers with short seasons. Determinate varieties are best for short seasons, while indeterminate varieties are good for year-round harvests.\n4. Peppers are notoriously slow to germinate and benefit from an early start in February. They can take up to a month to sprout and require a heat mat and ample light.\n5. Brassicas like broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower thrive in the cool weather of mid to late winter and early spring.\n6. Lettuce is an easy-to-grow green that can be started directly outdoors in February, as it can handle a little late frost.\n7. Carrots and parsnips should be direct-sown outdoors under row cover in February, as their deep taproots are sensitive to root disturbance.\n8. Onions and leeks should be planted in February to ensure healthy transplants when the ground warms.\n9. Farmers in cold climates can use protected environments like greenhouses, cold frames, and low/high tunnels to start seeds in February.",

      "summary": "The systems tested were: conventional tillage (CT), fall strip-tillage (ST), no-tillage (NT), and no-tillage with a cereal rye cover crop (NT+CR). Each system was paired with 3 starter fertilizer strategies: unfertilized control, 15 lb N/ac, and 15 lb N/ac + 10 lb S/ac.\n\nKey findings:\n- Starter fertilizer increased early-season soybean biomass by 12% on average, but these differences did not persist to later growth stages. Leaf nutrient levels were sufficient without starter.\n- Soybean yields ranged from 60-95 bu/ac across locations. Starter fertilizer did not significantly increase yields in any system.\n- Yields were similar across tillage systems, averaging 78.4 bu/ac for CT and ST, 77.6 bu/ac for NT, and 76.2 bu/ac for NT+CR.\n- When accounting for operational costs, NT had the highest partial net return, followed by ST and CT. NT+CR had the lowest partial net return due to higher cover crop management costs, though these could be offset by cost-share programs.\n\nThe project will continue in 2026 to track medium-term responses as the soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics change under the different conservation systems. Preliminary findings indicate soybean yields can be maintained under reduced tillage and cover crops, providing soil conservation benefits without sacrificing productivity.",

It has also affected crops in 15 other countries.\n\n- The research team, led by C.D. Cruz, associate professor of botany and plant pathology at Purdue, is using a mix of statistical, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, artificial intelligence, and computer vision methods to understand the dynamics of tar spot.\n\n- The research is funded by two USDA grants totaling nearly $1.1 million. Collaborators include researchers from Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S.\n\n- Researchers have developed a digital method (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn, which they have tested against human raters with promising results. They are now refining the training methods to improve the model's accuracy.\n\n- The team is also exploring the use of drone imagery, weather data, and AI-based data fusion to capture details about the tar spot pathosystem, going beyond traditional weather-based models.\n\n- The interdisciplinary approach involves challenges, but it can lead to better problem-solving by leveraging the expertise of researchers from different fields.\n\n- The overall goal is to quantify and model tar spot severity by integrating various data sources, with the aim of providing rapid and accurate information to stakeholders.",
