      "summary": "The group of local arcade and pinball enthusiasts purchased the church in March 2025 for $95,000.\n\nThe church, built in 1899, features sandstone bricks, stained glass windows, and high ceilings over 60 feet tall. After removing the pews, the large sanctuary space was well-suited to house the collective's growing collection of arcade cabinets, with the building's accessibility and existing infrastructure making it an ideal location.\n\nThe collective, which started as a loose network in 2021, previously had to store and transport their machines for the annual Pittsburgh Gaming Expo. Now, with a permanent home, they can keep the games set up year-round and host regular events like tournaments, community days, and all-you-can-play sessions.\n\nThe arcade, dubbed the \"Church Arcade,\" features a mix of retro video games and pinball machines spanning decades, including some classic multiplayer cabinets. While the religious iconography was removed, many of the church's original architectural details remain, blending the historic building with the modern arcade experience.\n\nThe project has been generally well-received by the Duquesne community, with neighbors expressing excitement about the new local attraction. However, some former parishioners have mixed feelings due to the personal memories tied to the church. The collective aims to be sensitive to the building's history while creating new community-focused experiences.\n\nThe arcade's founders, Mike Hough and Jon Snow, hope the Church Arcade will become a hub for local events and a destination that brings people together, similar to the church's original purpose. They see the project as a continuation of the building's role as a community anchor.",

But during cold winter weather and deep snow, cows may start eating fallen pine needles under trees, often coinciding with the last trimester of gestation when the fetus is most susceptible.\n\n- Studies have shown that once gestation reaches 42 days, herd pregnancy loss is usually only around 2% at most. However, sporadic late-term pregnancy losses can occur, and in rare cases, exposure to a toxin like pine needles can cause large-scale pregnancy losses.\n\n- Other pine tree species besides Ponderosa can also pose this threat. The issue has been recognized for at least the past 50 years in cattle production.\n\n- Cattle producers in less mountainous areas may be less familiar with this potential threat to beef cow pregnancies.",

In a letter to National FFA CEO Scott Stump, lawmakers Jason Smith (Missouri), David Schweikert (Arizona), and Tracey Mann (Kansas) raised concerns about FFA's partnership with agrochemical company Syngenta and its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\n\nThe lawmakers are seeking details on the FFA's partnership with Syngenta, including the financial arrangements and whether the partnership aligns with FFA's educational mission. They also requested information on FFA's DEI efforts, including specific steps taken and their impact on FFA membership.\n\nThe letter highlights the lawmakers' concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the organization's focus on issues beyond its core agricultural education programs. The lawmakers are requesting a response from the FFA by April 28, 2023.\n\nThis development comes as the National FFA Organization aims to modernize and expand its reach, but it faces scrutiny from some policymakers who want to ensure the group stays true to its traditional role of supporting agricultural education and youth development.",

Top sellers were Kinsey's Kookies and More, which sold 3,000 gobs, and Judy's Sweet Treats, which baked 1,050 gobs and won the \"best flavor\" award ($250 prize). The FARM BBQ and Bakery won \"best overall gob\" ($250).\n\nThe gob's origins trace back to the 1920s at the Harris-Boyer bakery in Johnstown, which trademarked the term in 1927. The treat became a local staple, with over 150,000 sold monthly in the 1960s. Theories on the gob's name include connections to sailors or coal miners. Amish women in eastern PA are also credited with inventing similar \"whoopie pies\" by using up excess cake batter.\n\nFor many attendees, the Gob Fest evokes fond memories and family traditions. Longtime vendor Judy Cooper learned to make gobs from her mother, while attendee Sam Uzelac recalled his mother sending him gobs while in the military. The Galleria's owner, Leo Karruli, hopes to continue the 20-year-old festival to support local businesses and preserve the region's gob legacy.",

This tire donation highlights the innovative uses of soybeans and their co-products in everyday products, and demonstrates the council's support for local law enforcement.\n\nThrough the \"Patrol With Soy\" program, each county will receive a set of Goodyear Eagle Enforcer All Weather tires, made with soybean oil in the tire tread compound, which provides year-round, pursuit-rated performance. The use of soybean oil instead of petroleum-based oils improves cold-weather flexibility and provides better traction in wet and snowy conditions.\n\nThe tire donation program will be ongoing over the next 2-3 years, until all 88 counties receive their donation. So far, tires have been donated to Crawford, Darke, Henry, Marion, Paulding, Ross, Seneca, Van Wert, and Wood Counties.\n\nThe program is a partnership between the Ohio Soybean Council and Goodyear, and it aims to showcase the different ways soybean oil is being used in products, as well as support the first responders in the communities where Ohio's soybean farmers live and work. The Ohio Soybean Council highlights that this partnership creates demand for the almost 5 million acres of soybeans planted in the state each year.",

There is no panacea in the form of fungicides to control it, so farmers must continue to rotate their crop and vigilantly spray their sugarbeet crop at the optimal time.\n\n- Cercospora leaf spot spreads mainly by wind, developing when weather conditions are warm and wet. Symptoms may be visible 5-7 days after infection if conditions are favorable.\n\n- The best time to spray for control is before sugarbeet plants are infected, but this is difficult as the fungus can survive the winter and spawn spores during warm spells.\n\n- Applying fungicide early in the season can slightly reduce its efficacy, but applying it too late results in greater loss. Monitoring fields to determine when rows will close is important for timing fungicide application.\n\n- NDSU researchers are studying whether there are bacteria that can control cercospora and whether wild sea beets with natural resistance can be crossed with conventional sugarbeets.\n\n- Researchers are also studying ways to reduce $900 million in annual losses from diseases that permeate sugarbeet piles when temperatures rise.\n\n- Besides disease, weeds annually cause $1.1 billion in losses to sugarbeet growers. An NDSU researcher is studying using drones to spray hot water on weeds as an alternative to herbicides.",

      "summary": "Over 80% of the world's flowering plants rely on pollinators to reproduce, and pollinators provide an estimated $200 billion in ecological services annually.\n\nThere are around 20,000 species of bees globally, with over 500 species found in Minnesota alone. Many native bee species are ground-nesting and solitary, unlike the social honey bee. Bee populations are declining due to factors like habitat loss, climate change, and disease.\n\nRestoring pollinator habitat on agricultural landscapes is critical. Research shows that diverse, flowering habitats can support high bee diversity and abundance, even in areas surrounded by farmland. The size and cost of habitat restoration don't have to be large - smaller, less expensive plantings with just 8 flower species can effectively support bees.\n\nPollinator habitats don't increase pest problems in adjacent crop fields, and can actually boost yields of self-pollinating crops like soybeans by up to 20% through improved pollination. Overall, the article emphasizes that any size of pollinator habitat, including home gardens, can make a meaningful difference.\n\nThe article cites research from the University of Minnesota Bee Lab and other sources. It includes comments from Dr. Dan Cariveau, an Associate Professor at the Bee Lab. The article was published on February 9, 2026.",

      "summary": "The goal was to determine if growers can maintain productivity and profitability while using reduced tillage and cover crops to protect the soil.\n\nThe study compared 4 management systems: conventional tillage (CT), fall strip-tillage (ST), no-tillage (NT), and no-tillage with a cereal rye cover crop (NT+CR). Each system was paired with 3 starter fertilizer strategies: unfertilized control, 15 lb N/ac, and 15 lb N/ac + 10 lb S/ac.\n\nKey findings:\n- Starter fertilizer increased early-season soybean biomass by ~12% but did not affect final yields.\n- Soybean yields ranged from 60-95 bu/ac across locations, with no significant differences between tillage systems. \n- When accounting for operational costs, NT had the highest partial net return, followed by ST and CT. NT+CR had the lowest net return due to cover crop management costs.\n- The project will continue in 2026 to track longer-term soil and soybean responses in the conservation systems.\n\nThe article includes:\n- Locations of trials in Illinois and Iowa\n- Cereal rye management details (40-50 lb/ac, 1000-1200 lb/ac biomass)\n- Soybean planting details (30-in rows, 140,000-150,000 seeds/ac)\n- Figures showing soybean growth, leaf nutrient levels, and yield distributions\n- Table of estimated costs, revenue, and partial net return for each system\n\nOverall, the results suggest that reduced tillage and cereal rye cover crops can maintain soybean yields compared to conventional tillage, although profitability may be impacted by the higher management costs. Further research is underway to understand longer-term implications.",

It can also involve practices like silvopasture (combining forestry and ranching) and alley cropping (growing crops between rows of trees).\n\nKey benefits of forest farming include:\n- Improved water and soil quality\n- Carbon sequestration (up to 22 lbs per year in first 20 years)\n- Habitat for beneficial insects, birds, mammals, fungi, and bacteria\n- Opportunities to grow specialty crops like mushrooms, ramps, syrups, and edible roots\n\nThe best candidates for forest farming are farms that already have forested areas or riparian zones with trees. It can be done on a small scale to provide cover for sensitive crops. Farmers should consult their agricultural extension office to develop a forest management plan.\n\nThere are also considerations around regulations, especially for wild plants, and the need to be proactive about marketing and selling forest-grown products through avenues like online sales, pick-your-own, and agritourism.",

Clarify Objectives: Spray drones can be useful for making applications on wet soils, applying to tall crops, reducing compaction, targeted applications, and supplementing existing spraying capacity.\n\n2. Regulatory Considerations: Farmers need an FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate, FAA Part 137 Certification for aerial pesticide application, and Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) licensing. Only products labeled for aerial use can be applied.\n\n3. Insurance and Risk Management: Farmers need specific coverage for chemical liability, general liability, and drone/equipment damage. Most standard policies do not cover these.\n\n4. Equipment Selection: Consider tank capacity, battery life, nozzle/atomizer options, GPS guidance, and local support when choosing a spray drone system.\n\n5. Training and Safe Operation: Proper training is essential, including gaining flight experience, calibration, weather monitoring, and maintenance.\n\n6. Gradual Adoption: Start on a small scale, compare to conventional methods, and develop efficient procedures before expanding use.\n\n7. Iowa-Based Resources: ISU Extension, Digital Ag Innovation Lab, licensed dealers, and IDALS can provide guidance and support.\n\n8. Future Developments: Ongoing improvements in payload, automation, and integration with precision ag data will shape the long-term role of spray drones.\n\nThe article recommends a thoughtful, step-by-step approach to spray drone adoption to ensure compliance, safety, and effective integration into Iowa farming operations.",

Their work is funded by two USDA grants totaling nearly $1.1 million.\n\nThe researchers are collaborating with colleagues in Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S. to address biosecurity challenges and provide rapid and accurate information to stakeholders. They have developed a digital method for quantifying tar spot in corn, which they have tested under field conditions against human raters.\n\nAnother research effort involves the laboratory of Purdue's Mohammad Jahanshahi, who has adapted his AI and computer-vision approaches from monitoring civil infrastructure to inspecting and analyzing agricultural disease epidemiology. Mariela Fernández-Campos, a PhD student, and Abhishek Subedi, a PhD student in civil engineering, are working on a proof-of-concept data fusion project that integrates drone imagery and weather data to capture crucial details about the tar spot pathosystem.\n\nThe team aims to quantify and model tar spot severity by referencing and integrating imagery with spatial and temporal data, ultimately providing farmers with rapid and accurate information about the disease.",

      "summary": "The new UW Madison publication \"Potassium Cycle\" provides a visual overview of the potassium cycle in Wisconsin cropping systems. The 2-page publication outlines key potassium concepts, including:\n\n- Potassium is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development, playing a role in photosynthesis, drought resistance, and overall plant health.\n- Potassium enters the soil through weathering of minerals, organic matter decomposition, and fertilizer application. It is taken up by crops, can leach, and is also removed in harvested products.\n- Optimal potassium levels in soil are 100-200 ppm. Deficient levels can reduce yields, while excess potassium can antagonize other nutrient uptake.\n- Soil testing is recommended to determine potassium needs. Fertilizer application rates should be based on crop removal and soil test results.\n- Cover cropping, manure application, and reducing tillage can help retain potassium in the soil system.\n\nThe publication is available free of charge from the UW Madison Nutrient and Pest Management (NPM) program. Farmers are encouraged to review the resource to better understand the potassium cycle and optimize potassium management for their operations.",

As of mid-April, 80% of the state's winter wheat was in the jointing stage, compared to the typical 50-60% at this time. However, the advanced growth stage increases the risk of frost damage. Farmers are advised to closely monitor their fields and consider frost protection measures if temperatures drop below 24°F. Despite the early progress, overall winter wheat condition in Wisconsin is reported as 72% good to excellent, slightly lower than the 5-year average of 75%. Experts recommend that farmers scout fields regularly, apply fungicides proactively, and stay up-to-date on the latest weather forecasts to manage the 2023 winter wheat crop effectively.",

Stands below 80,000 plants per acre may warrant replanting.\n- Factors to evaluate include current plant population, growth stage, growing conditions, and expected yield of the current stand vs. a replanted crop.\n- Replanting should be done within 7-10 days of the initial planting to maximize yield potential. Later replanting can result in up to 10% yield reduction.\n- Replanting expenses include seed, fuel, labor, and potential crop insurance implications. Weighing costs vs. expected yield increase is important.\n- Shawn P. Conley, a soybean and small grains specialist at UW-Madison, advises carefully evaluating the field before making a replanting decision.",
