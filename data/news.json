      "summary": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has updated its Herbicide Strategy, elevating the role of adjuvants from optional add-ons to essential tools in reducing pesticide drift. This shift is driven by the EPA's focus on minimizing off-target movement of herbicides.\n\nUnder the new strategy, adjuvants are now considered necessary components of herbicide applications, rather than just luxury items. Adjuvants help improve the effectiveness and reduce the drift of herbicides, making them critical for compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nThe increased emphasis on adjuvants has significant implications for farmers. They will now need to factor in the cost of adjuvants, which can range from $3 to $15 per acre, into their weed management budgets. Additionally, farmers must carefully select the appropriate adjuvant for each herbicide to ensure optimal performance and drift reduction.\n\nManufacturers of adjuvants, such as Corteva Agriscience and Winfield United, are responding to the EPA's new strategy by developing new and improved adjuvant products. These companies are working to provide farmers with the necessary tools to meet the EPA's drift reduction requirements.\n\nThe EPA's Herbicide Strategy is part of its broader efforts to address the issue of pesticide drift, which can have negative impacts on neighboring crops, sensitive habitats, and human health. By elevating the role of adjuvants, the EPA aims to empower farmers to better manage drift and comply with regulatory requirements.",

Feeding distillers at up to 50% of the diet had no negative impacts on carcass quality.\n\nThe article recommends that farmers work with their nutritionist to determine the optimal inclusion rate of distillers feed in their beef operations. Factors to consider include cattle type, feeding program, and local prices of distillers relative to other feedstuffs.\n\nIn conclusion, the article emphasizes that distillers feed can be a cost-effective way for beef producers to meet the energy and protein needs of their cattle.

While recent rains have limited their ability to test the full impact, Iowa State data has shown yield increases from the system. Experts like Chris Hay of Hay Water Solutions say the system can provide a 3-inch supplemental water supply during dry summer periods.\n\nAn economic analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund found drainage water recycling can boost crop yield income by $130-$146 per acre annually, while saving $10-$20 per acre in operating costs. The practice also provides water quality benefits by reducing nutrient runoff.\n\nHowever, these systems require a significant upfront investment of $2-$3 million, plus ongoing maintenance. Experts recommend having a pond that can store 4-6 inches of water for the irrigated area. Funding will likely require both private farmer investment and public/outside support.\n\nThe Blairs advise other farmers interested in this to seek local help and expertise to plan and implement the system.

This is due to increased poultry production, even as wings remain a hugely popular Super Bowl snack.\n\nThe article cites Texas A&M AgriLife Extension economist David Anderson, who says wings have become a cultural tradition for the Super Bowl, similar to hot dogs on the 4th of July. He notes that wing production is limited by animal physiology, but overall U.S. production this year is estimated at 17.5 billion wings, with about 8.5% consumed just during the Super Bowl.\n\nAnderson says the Super Bowl represents the pinnacle of chicken wing demand each year, and that he will personally be making wings to enjoy for the big game.",

As of January 1, 2026, the total U.S. cattle and calves population was 86.2 million head, slightly below the previous year. \n\nKey statistics:\n- Total cattle and calves: 86.2 million head (Jan 1, 2026)\n- All cows and heifers that have calved: 37.2 million head\n- Beef cows: 27.6 million head (down 1% year-over-year) \n- Milk cows: 9.57 million head (up from last year)\n- 2025 calf crop: 32.9 million head (down from prior year)\n- Cattle on feed: 13.8 million head (down 3% from 2025)\n\nThis report signals a slow start to any nationwide herd rebuild, with beef cow numbers and calf crop down year-over-year. Replacement heifer numbers saw a modest increase, but overall the data points to tight near-term feeder cattle supplies.\n\nFor cow-calf producers, the tight supplies mean continued strong prices for calves and bred females, but rebuilding takes time. Stocker and feedlot operators face elevated competition for available feeder cattle. Expansion is likely to be slow and uneven, influenced more by forage conditions, replacement economics, and producer risk appetite than headline prices.",
