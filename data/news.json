There is no panacea in the form of fungicides to control it, so farmers must continue to rotate their crop and vigilantly spray their sugarbeet crop at the optimal time.\n\n- Cercospora leaf spot spreads mainly by wind, developing when weather conditions are warm and wet. Symptoms may be visible 5-7 days after infection if conditions are favorable.\n\n- The best time to spray for control is before sugarbeet plants are infected, but this is difficult as the fungus can survive the winter and spawn spores during warm spells.\n\n- Applying fungicide early in the season can slightly reduce its efficacy, but applying it too late results in greater loss. Monitoring fields to determine when rows will close is important for timing fungicide application.\n\n- NDSU researchers are studying whether there are bacteria that can control cercospora and whether wild sea beets with natural resistance can be crossed with conventional sugarbeets.\n\n- Researchers are also studying ways to reduce $900 million in annual losses from diseases that permeate sugarbeet piles when temperatures rise.\n\n- Besides disease, weeds annually cause $1.1 billion in losses to sugarbeet growers. An NDSU researcher is studying using drones to spray hot water on weeds as an alternative to herbicides.",

This move is intended to help offset supply chain disruptions and rising beef prices in the U.S. The previous quota of 20,000 mt had been in place since 2015.\n\nThe expanded quota will allow more Argentine beef to be imported duty-free into the U.S. Beef exports from Argentina to the U.S. were previously limited to just 20,000 mt per year under a trade agreement.\n\nArgentina's beef production and exports have been rising in recent years, and the country is seeking to grow its market access globally. This increased import quota represents an opportunity for Argentina's beef industry to expand its sales to the lucrative U.S. market.\n\nFor U.S. farmers and ranchers, the expanded beef imports from Argentina could put some downward pressure on domestic beef prices, which have been rising due to supply chain issues and strong consumer demand. However, the additional 60,000 mt represents a relatively small fraction of total U.S. beef consumption, so the impact on U.S. producers may be limited.",

      "summary": "Over 80% of the world's flowering plants rely on pollinators to reproduce, and pollinators provide an estimated $200 billion in ecological services annually.\n\nThere are around 20,000 species of bees globally, with over 500 species found in Minnesota alone. Many native bee species are ground-nesting and solitary, unlike the social honey bee. Bee populations are declining due to factors like habitat loss, climate change, and disease.\n\nRestoring pollinator habitat on agricultural landscapes is critical. Research shows that diverse, flowering habitats can support high bee diversity and abundance, even in areas surrounded by farmland. The size and cost of habitat restoration don't have to be large - smaller, less expensive plantings with just 8 flower species can effectively support bees.\n\nPollinator habitats don't increase pest problems in adjacent crop fields, and can actually boost yields of self-pollinating crops like soybeans by up to 20% through improved pollination. Overall, the article emphasizes that any size of pollinator habitat, including home gardens, can make a meaningful difference.\n\nThe article cites research from the University of Minnesota Bee Lab and other sources. It includes comments from Dr. Dan Cariveau, an Associate Professor at the Bee Lab. The article was published on February 9, 2026.",

It supports all aspects of poultry, meat, and egg production and processing, and includes two classrooms.\n\nBill Huffman, who earned a bachelor's degree in poultry science from Texas A&M in 1953, has a long history of devotion to the department. In 1952, he was a member of the winning Texas A&M Junior Poultry Judging Team and the highest-scoring individual on the Senior National Poultry Judging Contest team.\n\nThe Huffmans' support for poultry science at Texas A&M extends beyond the renamed complex. In 2020, they established the Barbara J. Huffman and William M. \"Bill\" Huffman '53 Chair in Poultry Science, and they have also donated funds for a trophy case in the Kleberg Animal and Food Sciences Center. Additionally, the Huffmans have supported various other programs and initiatives at Texas A&M.\n\nAccording to Audrey McElroy, Ph.D., professor and head of the Department of Poultry Science, the Huffmans' \"visionary support reflects a deep belief in the power of poultry science to prepare students, advance discovery and serve the industries that feed the world.\" The renaming of the complex is a testament to the Huffmans' commitment and a means to ensure the continued leadership of Texas A&M in advancing poultry science and supporting the industries that depend on it.",

The true indicator of content effectiveness is now attention time - whether a farmer stays engaged and explores more content.\n\nAgWeb.com recently redesigned to increase user attention and engagement:\n- 54% increase in readers reaching 75% of an article\n- 21% increase in readers reaching 90% of an article\n- 33% increase in mobile users reading more articles per visit\n\nThese deeper engagement metrics are more valuable to advertisers, as they signal real interest and create stronger opportunities for brand messaging to be seen and remembered. \n\nThe article notes that in a typical visit, readers only absorb about 28% of page text, so simplifying layouts and guiding deeper engagement is key.\n\nFor advertisers, high-attention environments like the redesigned AgWeb deliver stronger brand recall, message retention, and advertising effectiveness. This creates more value through more time with content, more exposure opportunities per session, and better alignment with how farmers search today.\n\nThe article concludes that if the goal is to reach farmers in focused, engaged moments, AgWeb offers one of the most effective digital environments in agriculture, as better attention leads directly to better outcomes.",

      "summary": "The systems tested were: conventional tillage (CT), strip-tillage (ST), no-tillage (NT), and no-tillage with a cereal rye cover crop (NT+CR). Each system was paired with 3 starter fertilizer strategies: unfertilized control, 15 lb N/ac, and 15 lb N/ac + 10 lb S/ac.\n\nEarly soybean growth showed a response to starter fertilizer, with 12% higher biomass at the V4 stage. However, by the R2 stage, leaf tissue N and S levels were sufficient across all treatments, indicating the soybeans could meet their nutrient needs through biological fixation and soil organic matter. \n\nSoybean yields ranged from 60-95 bu/ac across the sites. Starter fertilizer did not significantly increase yields. Yields were similar across tillage systems, with CT/ST averaging 78.4 bu/ac, NT 77.6 bu/ac, and NT+CR 76.2 bu/ac.\n\nWhen factoring in costs, NT had the highest partial net return, followed by ST and CT. NT+CR had the lowest partial net return due to higher cover crop management costs of $55/ac, though this can be offset by conservation program cost-share.\n\nThe trials will continue in 2026 to track medium-term effects on soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics in these conservation systems. This will provide valuable insights to help farmers adopt conservation practices without sacrificing yield.",

      "summary": "This approach originated in Brazil's tropical rainforests and can be a good option for farmers with forested land.\n\nForest farming involves thinning out a forest to create the optimal conditions for growing crops in the understory, such as native ornamentals, fungi, fruit, timber, and forest food crops. It can also involve practices like silvopasture (combining forestry and ranching) and alley cropping (growing crops between rows of trees).\n\nKey benefits of forest farming include:\n- Improved water and soil quality\n- Carbon sequestration (up to 22 lbs per year in first 20 years)\n- Habitat for beneficial insects, birds, mammals, fungi, and bacteria\n- Opportunities to grow specialty crops like mushrooms, ramps, syrups, and edible roots\n\nThe best candidates for forest farming are farms that already have forested areas or riparian zones with trees. It can be done on a small scale to provide cover for sensitive crops. Farmers should consult their agricultural extension office to develop a forest management plan.\n\nThere are also considerations around regulations, especially for wild plants, and the need to be proactive about marketing and selling forest-grown products through avenues like online sales, pick-your-own, and agritourism.",

The disease, which had been endemic in several Latin American countries since 1904, was first detected in the U.S. in 2015 and has since spread to 16 states and Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe research team, led by C.D. Cruz, associate professor of botany and plant pathology at Purdue, is using a mix of statistical analysis, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, artificial intelligence, and computer vision to better understand the dynamics of tar spot in corn. Their work is funded by two USDA grants totaling nearly $1.1 million.\n\nThe researchers are collaborating with colleagues in Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S. to address biosecurity challenges and provide rapid and accurate information to stakeholders. They have developed a digital method for quantifying tar spot in corn, which they have tested under field conditions against human raters.\n\nAnother research effort involves the laboratory of Purdue's Mohammad Jahanshahi, who has adapted his AI and computer-vision approaches from monitoring civil infrastructure to inspecting and analyzing agricultural disease epidemiology. Mariela Fernández-Campos, a PhD student, and Abhishek Subedi, a PhD student in civil engineering, are working on a proof-of-concept data fusion project that integrates drone imagery and weather data to capture crucial details about the tar spot pathosystem.\n\nThe team aims to quantify and model tar spot severity by referencing and integrating imagery with spatial and temporal data, ultimately providing farmers with rapid and accurate information about the disease.",

It is taken up by crops, can leach, and is also removed in harvested products.\n- Optimal potassium levels in soil are 100-200 ppm. Deficient levels can reduce yields, while excess potassium can antagonize other nutrient uptake.\n- Soil testing is recommended to determine potassium needs. Fertilizer application rates should be based on crop removal and soil test results.\n- Cover cropping, manure application, and reducing tillage can help retain potassium in the soil system.\n\nThe publication is available free of charge from the UW Madison Nutrient and Pest Management (NPM) program. Farmers are encouraged to review the resource to better understand the potassium cycle and optimize potassium management for their operations.",
