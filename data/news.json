      "summary": "Silage delay, which provides payments ranging from $700 to $1,100 per acre, is the primary scenario used to compensate landowners impacted by nesting tricolored blackbirds. The closest remaining option is \"delayed mowing on hay fields,\" which provides only $200 per acre.\n\nThe decision to omit silage delay was made at the federal level within NRCS, while the state of California continues efforts to advocate for its inclusion. The California Farm Bureau, along with other stakeholders like Audubon, Western United Dairies, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, are coordinating to urge NRCS to retain silage delay as a funding option. It remains unclear when the final payment scenarios will be announced, but a decision is expected soon as the tricolored blackbird nesting season approaches.\n\nThe California Farm Bureau has stated that the omission of silage delay as a payment scenario would \"significantly hinder the ability to effectively protect tricolored blackbird colonies and to sustain strong partnerships with agricultural producers who voluntarily participate in the program.\"",

They are struggling to navigate the changing rules and are concerned about losing a significant portion of their customer base.\n\nExperts warn that these SNAP restrictions will likely result in \"more chaos\" and could negatively impact the ability of low-income families to access affordable, nutritious foods.

This was due to a shortage of high-quality cattle in the northern plains, leading to prices generally increasing throughout the year.\n- For 2026, there is no indication that the basis levels would be different from the historical trend.\n- A 5-year average of historic basis levels can be used to smooth out variations and incorporate seasonal patterns in the underlying cash prices.\n- The expected basis varies by month - it is typically less than the futures price early and late in the year, reflecting transportation costs, while it is higher in May due to the seasonal high in cash prices.\n- The article includes a table showing the expected live cattle basis (in $/cwt) by month, based on the 2021-2025 historical average.\n\nIn summary, the article provides farmers with insights into understanding and forecasting live cattle basis levels in their local market, which can help them make more informed marketing decisions.",

BQA training covers key areas such as animal behavior and handling, herd health management, biosecurity, record-keeping, emergency action planning, and transportation.\n\n5. By using research to support BQA practices, Dr. Rush helps producers understand that the program is not about meeting minimum requirements but about improving consistency and accountability across the beef supply chain.\n\n6. After BQA trainings, Dr. Rush often sees producers making management changes that reflect BQA principles, ranging from simple tasks like vaccine mixing to more complex efforts like developing biosecurity plans.\n\n7.

Stronger soybean prices and economic returns are expected to drive farmers to shift acres from corn, wheat, and cotton into soybeans over the next 5 years. \n\nSoybean prices are projected to average $13.80 per bushel in 2022, up from $12.80 in 2021. Corn prices are expected to average $5.75 per bushel in 2022, down from $6.05 in 2021.\n\nThe 6% increase in soybean acres would come at the expense of 1.5 million fewer corn acres, 600,000 fewer wheat acres, and 300,000 fewer cotton acres by 2026.\n\nThe shift towards more soybean production is driven by projections of stronger cash returns for soybeans compared to other major field crops. Soybean cash returns are forecast to average $249 per acre from 2022-2026, versus $227 per acre for corn, $202 per acre for wheat, and $570 per acre for cotton.\n\nFarmers should consider adjusting their crop mix and allocating more acres to soybeans to capitalize on the expected stronger soybean returns over the next 5 years.",

Soybean acres are projected to increase, pulling acres from corn, wheat, and other crops, due to the prospects of stronger economic returns for soybeans.\n\nKey findings:\n- Soybean acres could increase by 3-5% in 2023 compared to 2022.\n- Corn acres may decrease by 1-3% in 2023.\n- Wheat acres could decline by 2-4% in 2023.\n\nThe analysis cites several factors contributing to the shift:\n- Improved profitability outlook for soybeans compared to other crops.\n- Relatively high soybean prices, expected to average $14.50-$15.50 per bushel in 2023.\n- Increasing global demand for soybeans, especially from China.\n\nThe shift in acreage could have the following impacts for farmers:\n- Increased soybean production, potentially leading to lower soybean prices.\n- Reduced corn and wheat supplies, potentially leading to higher prices for these commodities.\n\nThe analysis recommends that farmers closely monitor market conditions and make planting decisions accordingly to maximize their returns.",

      "summary": "A team of entomologists led by John Wenzel, Andy Deans, and Marc Branham will conduct the survey to determine how many firefly species exist in Pennsylvania and where they are located. \n\nCurrently, the entomologists estimate there are 30-33 different firefly species in the state. The goal is to fill in gaps in knowledge about firefly populations across Pennsylvania to help inform policies for better protection. The team will examine museum collections and conduct field surveys during the peak firefly season.\n\nThe inventory will focus on areas like the Allegheny National Forest, which is known for high firefly populations. Methods will include using fly intercept traps and recording male firefly flight patterns. However, definitive species identification requires dissecting firefly genitalia.\n\nThe inventory is prompted by concerns about potential firefly declines, as they are becoming harder to find outside of protected natural areas. Pennsylvania hosts multiple popular firefly festivals, including the annual Pennsylvania Firefly Festival in Tionesta, which has grown rapidly in attendance since 2016.\n\nOrganizers Peggy and Ken Butler now use a lottery system to limit the festival to 75 attendees for two nighttime tours. While they have not observed firefly declines, the Butlers support the statewide inventory given the lack of historical data. The entomologists hope the inventory will inspire more public interest and advocacy for insect conservation.",

      "summary": "The toolkit, developed through AgriLife's Disaster Assessment and Recovery (DAR) program, provides design guidance and technical drawings for nature-based solutions like rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable surfaces that can be used alongside traditional stormwater infrastructure.\n\nThe goal is to help communities better manage stormwater and reduce flooding, which is an ongoing challenge in Texas due to intense rainfall, development, and aging drainage systems. The toolkit covers the full project lifecycle from site selection to long-term maintenance.\n\nThe GIFT toolkit was launched in late 2025 with support from the Texas General Land Office and is now available statewide. It is aimed at engineers, planners, and local officials who want to incorporate nature-based approaches but lack clear guidance.\n\nCharriss York of AgriLife Extension's DAR program says these nature-based solutions can create multi-purpose public spaces that benefit both people and wildlife, rather than just fenced-off detention areas. Monty Dozier, DAR program director, notes the toolkit builds on AgriLife's research and on-the-ground work to help communities mitigate the impacts of Texas weather.\n\nThe toolkit is part of DAR's broader effort to support long-term disaster mitigation, rather than just disaster response. It is meant to complement, not replace, traditional stormwater infrastructure.",

Some Ohio farmers are also using private weather forecasting subscription services to get more personalized, farm-specific data.\n\nDuane Stateler, a crop and hog farmer in northwestern Ohio, has used a private weather forecasting service for 14 years. His service, BAMwx.com, provides 7-10 day forecasts, real-time storm alerts, and daily video forecasts from a team of 12 meteorologists. Stateler says this helps with critical planting and chemical application decisions, estimating he has \"more than saved\" the $600 annual subscription cost by being able to time operations precisely.\n\nThe article notes that other agricultural forecasting tools are also emerging, such as Ranchbot for pasture management, and companies like Tempest and DTN using public data and machine learning to deliver hyper-local forecasts. \n\nOhio State Extension plans to install mesonet weather stations in all 88 counties by 2025, providing public data to improve disease/pest scouting alerts, crop modeling, and temperature monitoring for farmers.\n\nAaron Wilson, an OSU Extension climate specialist, says short-term forecasting is most reliable 3-5 days out, so denser data networks are key to increasing accuracy for agricultural needs like planting windows and drought monitoring.",

      "summary": "The Texas A&M Forest Service awarded $14 million in grants to Texas volunteer fire departments through the Rural Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Program (RVFDAP). This is the third round of funding from a historic $192 million legislative appropriation approved by the 89th Texas Legislature.\n\nThe RVFDAP, established by Texas House Bill 2604 in 2001, provides grants to rural volunteer fire departments for essential firefighting equipment and training. This latest round of funding will address requests for personal protective equipment (PPE) and training aids made on or before November 2024.\n\nThe first two rounds of funding in October and December 2025 awarded a total of $181.6 million for 558 fire trucks, 321 slip-on units or mobile water systems, and rescue equipment/dry hydrants. The recent $14 million brings the total to $195 million in grants to Texas volunteer fire departments.\n\nWhile the latest round largely satisfies outstanding requests, the RVFDAP also secured approximately $88 million in base funding for fiscal years 2026-27 to address ongoing equipment needs at the local level. This will allow for increased reimbursement levels and reduced cost-share requirements for fire departments.\n\nTexas fire departments can access resources through FireConnect, a centralized database managed by the Texas A&M Forest Service. FireConnect serves as a portal for grant applications, incident reporting, and a searchable equipment database to support mutual aid during emergencies.\n\nJason Keiningham, capacity building department head for the Texas A&M Forest Service, stated that this funding has allowed them to \"expedite the awards schedule to cover the list of unfunded requests\" and provide support to fire departments that may have been on waiting lists for years.",

Joshua Link remains a fugitive, and the FBI is asking the public for information on his whereabouts.\n\nAgridime, which launched in 2017, had operations in Texas, Arizona, Kansas, North Dakota, and other states. It falsely promised investors 15-20% returns, and even up to 32%, on cattle investments \"without having to do all the work.\" However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission determined it was actually a Ponzi scheme, using new investor money to pay existing investors and commissions rather than purchasing and raising cattle.\n\nThe indictments allege the defendants collected over $220 million from more than 2,200 victims nationwide. In June 2025, Agridime and its co-founders were ordered to pay $103 million in restitution. \n\nIf convicted, the defendants face up to 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud or conspiracy, and up to 10 years for each count of money laundering. U.S. Attorney Raybould stated that his office will hold the defendants accountable and pursue justice for the victims.",

Sandy soils are less ideal as they don't expand/contract as much during freeze-thaw.\n\n- Adequate spring moisture is vital for establishing a healthy stand after frost seeding. The success of frost seeded stands depends significantly on spring moisture levels.\n\n- The author is Dr. Shelby Gruss, an assistant professor and forage extension specialist who joined Iowa State University in November 2023.

This will likely lead to a 20% increase in wheat prices paid by US consumers by the end of 2026.\n\nThe USDA is offering $500 million in emergency aid to wheat farmers to help offset these losses. Applications for the aid program are due by June 30, 2026.\n\nExperts predict these wheat supply and price challenges will continue for the next 12-18 months, until production can recover.

Slow-growing herbs like basil and rosemary, which take 1 week to 1 month to germinate.\n2. Tomatoes, which need 80+ days from seed to fruit. Opt for determinate varieties in short seasons or indeterminate for year-round harvests.\n3. Peppers, which can take up to 1 month to sprout and need 2+ months to mature. Choose productive varieties like jalapeño, serrano, or shishito.\n4. Brassicas like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale, which thrive in cool weather. Leafy types mature quickly, while heading types need more tending.\n5. Lettuce, which can handle some late frost and is easy to start directly sown or in trays.\n6. Carrots and parsnips, which need to be direct sown due to their sensitive taproots.\n7. Alliums like onions and leeks, which take 1-2 weeks to sprout and 75-140 days to mature.\n\nThe article notes that February is the right time to start these crops, as they either take a long time to mature, are slow to germinate, or prefer the cool conditions of early spring. Proper growing setups like greenhouses and cold frames can protect these plants until the weather warms.",

NT+CR had the lowest net return due to higher cover crop expenses.\n- The project will continue into 2026 to track longer-term soil and nutrient dynamics under these conservation systems.",

Farmers should clearly define their specific goals before investing.\n\nRegulations: Operators must have an FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate and Part 137 Certification for aerial pesticide application. State-level IDALS licensing is also required. Rules change frequently, so checking for updates is important.\n\nInsurance: Standard farm policies don't cover aerial application risks. Farmers need chemical, general, and physical damage liability coverage specific to drone operations.\n\nEquipment: Factors to consider include spray capacity, battery life, nozzle options, and GPS/automation features. Local dealer support is also key.\n\nTraining: Proper training on safe operation, calibration, and weather monitoring is essential. Iowa State offers educational programs on compliance and best practices.\n\nAdoption Approach: Farmers are encouraged to start small, compare results to conventional methods, and gradually scale up as they gain experience. Dry product applications can also be evaluated cautiously.\n\nResources: Iowa State University, the Digital Ag Innovation Lab, licensed dealers, and IDALS can all provide support for farmers new to spray drone technology.\n\nThe article highlights that spray drones can be a valuable addition, but successful integration requires careful planning and a thoughtful, stepwise approach. Staying up-to-date on regulations, safety, and best practices is crucial.",

      "summary": "Winter sowing involves starting seeds in containers like milk jugs or plastic bags and placing them outdoors, where the cold, moist conditions help the seeds break dormancy. This results in hardier transplants that mature sooner than they would otherwise.\n\nThe best vegetables for winter sowing include hardy greens like kale and cabbage, as well as spinach, onions, and leafy greens like chard and watercress. These plants can handle cold temperatures in their early stages.\n\nFor flowers, the article recommends sowing perennials like pansies, echinacea, snapdragons, larkspur, and scabiosa. Many of these need a period of cold stratification, which the winter sowing method provides.\n\nSpecific varieties mentioned include 'Carex' cabbage for shorter maturation, 'Avon' spinach for mildew resistance, and different groups of snapdragons suited to varying light and heat conditions.\n\nThe article notes that winter sowing offers the benefits of direct sowing with less risk, and provides a natural way to break dormancy for plants that require cold stratification. It's an excellent method for farmers looking to get a head start on the growing season.",

Cruz, associate professor of botany and plant pathology, is using a mix of statistical, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, artificial intelligence, and computer vision methods to understand the dynamics of tar spot in corn.\n\nThe research is funded by two grants totaling nearly $1.1 million from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The team is collaborating with researchers from Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S.\n\nThe researchers have developed a digital method called the stromata contouring detection algorithm (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn. They have tested the algorithm under field conditions and found it to be successful in quantifying trends, but some inaccuracies persist in fully automated scenarios. The team is now refining their training methods to improve the model's accuracy and performance.\n\nAnother research effort includes the laboratory of Purdue's Mohammad Jahanshahi, associate professor in the Lyles School of Civil and Construction Engineering and the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Jahanshahi and Cruz, along with their students, are working on a proof-of-concept data fusion project that integrates drone imagery and weather data to capture crucial details about the tar spot pathosystem.\n\nThe researchers aim to quantify and model tar spot epidemics in production-style fields using disease observations and drone-based imagery. Ultimately, the team wants to quantify and model tar spot severity by referencing and integrating imagery with spatial and temporal data.\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of the project can place greater time demands on the researchers, but it also leads to better problem-solving as each person brings their own expertise to the table.",
