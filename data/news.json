      "summary": "February is a good time to decide on seeds, as the choice can impact the success and duration of the tomato harvest. \n\nMcKernan notes that most home garden tomatoes are indeterminate varieties, which continue growing and producing fruit throughout the season. Determinate tomatoes are more compact and have a shorter fruiting period. He suggests planting a mix of both types if possible, to get a large harvest for canning as well as a steady supply of fresh tomatoes.\n\nTomatoes in Kansas are typically planted in early to mid-May, when daytime temperatures are above 70°F and the risk of frost has passed. However, in some areas planting may need to be delayed until mid-to-late May. Hot, dry Kansas summers can also cause a mid-season lull in tomato production, as the plants struggle to set fruit when temperatures exceed 95°F during the day and 75°F at night.\n\nMcKernan recommends that gardeners choose tomato varieties with strong disease resistance characteristics. K-State's Horticulture Newsletter provides weekly tips for home gardeners, who can also reach out to their local extension office with questions.",

This left the remaining 12 employees working around the clock.\n\n3. South Dakota has actively courted large-scale dairy operations through tax incentives, streamlined permitting, and financial aid for infrastructure. For example, the state granted Warner-based Silverstreak Dairies up to $12 million in November 2025 to develop manure containment systems as they plan to double their herd to 5,400 cows.\n\n4. The labor shortage issue is exacerbated by the fact that Americans are typically unwilling to take on these demanding dairy jobs, according to Rick Naerebout of the Idaho Dairymen's Association.\n\n5.

He says the 1980s farm crisis led many farm families to discourage the next generation from returning to farming.\n\n6. Small dairy farms in South Dakota are struggling with low milk prices and limited access to processing facilities, making it difficult for them to \"make it work\" in the current market.\n\n7.

This reflects the financial pressures faced by farmers due to factors like low commodity prices and rising input costs.\n\nThe article does not provide specific numbers or statistics. However, it suggests that the increased reliance on operating loans is a concerning trend, as it indicates the erosion of farmers' financial resilience and working capital. \n\nThe article does not mention any deadlines, names of people/organizations beyond the lender quoted, or provide recommendations for farmers. There are also no expert quotes included.\n\nThe key impact for farmers highlighted is the depletion of their working capital and increased need to rely on operating loans to cover regular expenses as they prepare for the next growing season.

Snow knockers - blacksmith-made iron hammers - were used to remove ice and snow from horses' hooves. Sleigh bells alerted others to an approaching sleigh.\n\nSleighing also involved nighttime torchlight caravans to neighboring towns for parties around a bonfire, allowing residents to socialize and build community.

Farmer Eli Mack has incorporated more trees on his 50-head beef cattle operation, Mack Farms, in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. Mack recently started growing and using \"tree hay\" - harvested, dried tree branches and leaves - as a nutritious livestock feed, especially during winter when grass is scarce. Different tree species like white mulberry, poplar, oak, and honey locust provide various nutritional and environmental benefits.\n\nWhile agroforestry was long overlooked, it is becoming more accepted today. Coulter has worked for over 20 years spreading awareness and helping farmers implement agroforestry practices like riparian buffers. Her work has protected water, built soil, and supported biodiversity. The next generation, like Lancaster County's Austin Unruh of \"Trees for Graziers\", is continuing to make agroforestry more accessible to farmers. Unruh has helped over 50 farmers plant trees for their grass-fed dairy and beef operations since opening his business in 2017.",

Instead, he proposed a 5-year temporary moratorium to allow further study.\n\nThe South Dakota Cattlemen's Association opposed the bill, fearing it could lead to other states restricting South Dakota's agricultural products. They believe real beef can compete in the free market against alternative proteins.\n\nIn 2025, South Dakota passed a law requiring clear labeling of cell-cultured protein products. The state also prohibited using any state funds for these products.\n\nWhile the banned products are not yet in grocery stores, the Cattlemen's Association believes they will likely have a limited market impact over time, similar to other alternative protein products.\n\nThe South Dakota Stockgrowers Association, which supported the original bill, disagrees with Rhoden's veto but will support the proposed 5-year moratorium.",

This represents 47% growth, far outpacing the 18% increase to the rest of the world.\n- The USMCA has generated $149 billion in total economic contribution to the U.S. economy and supported nearly 500,000 jobs and $36 billion in wages.\n- For every $1 in ag exports under USMCA, another $2.45 of economic activity was supported, contributing $64 billion to U.S. GDP and $13 billion in tax revenue.\n\nThe USMCA must undergo a formal review by July 2026 to determine whether to renew the agreement for another 16 years. Failure to renew would lead to the agreement's expiration in 2036.\n\nWhile the coalition sees USMCA as positive overall, they note issues that need to be addressed, including:\n- Canada's management of dairy tariff-rate quotas\n- Mexico not fully implementing commitments on preserving common cheese names\n- The need for clearer rules on agricultural biotech and more access for U.S. ethanol in Mexico\n\nExperts warn that without USMCA, the U.S. farm economy would face greater instability in an already challenging environment.",

      "summary": "North Dakota farmers will face greater risk this year as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency has eliminated the extra \"buy-up\" coverage option for prevented planting insurance. \n\nFrom 2010 to 2024, the extra prevented planting coverage led to $3.18 billion in payments for North Dakota producers, more than any other state. This option allowed farmers to insure against years when weather prevents them from planting a crop.\n\nWithout this option in 2026, North Dakota farmers like Justin Quandt, who farms near Oakes, will have less protection against wet spring conditions that can leave some of their fields unplantable. Quandt's family normally invests in the additional prevented planting coverage, which requires insuring all acres in a county.\n\nThe North Dakota Farmers Union president Matt Perdue said the agency's decision is disappointing, as the recent farm bill had expanded federal crop insurance in other ways. However, an NDSU study concluded that the improvements will not outweigh the loss of the extra prevented planting coverage for North Dakota.\n\nSenators, including John Hoeven of North Dakota, have asked the USDA to undo the prevented planting changes for 2027 and beyond \"to help provide a layer of certainty when disasters beyond their control render them unable to plant a crop.\" \n\nFarmers face a March 15 deadline to make 2026 crop insurance purchases. Insurance agent Bethany Rentz hopes the USDA will bring back the extra prevented planting coverage based on pushback from other affected states.",

Bee populations, including the endangered rusty patch bumblebee, have seen dramatic declines across North America due to factors like habitat loss, climate change, and disease.\n\n3. Restoring pollinator habitat on agricultural landscapes is important, and can be done cost-effectively. Planting a diverse mix of flowering plants, even in small areas, can support a variety of bee species.\n\n4. Research shows that the amount of surrounding agricultural land or size of the habitat area does not significantly impact bee diversity and abundance, as long as there are sufficient floral resources.\n\n5. Integrating pollinator habitat into croplands can have benefits for natural pest control, and can even improve yields for self-pollinating crops like soybeans.\n\n6. Funding sources and conservation programs may be available to assist farmers in establishing and maintaining pollinator habitat.\n\n7. Minnesota alone has around 525 species of bees, ranging from tiny to large bumblebees. Native bee species, including ground-nesting bees, are the focus of research at the University of Minnesota Bee Lab.",

Prairie Strips: Planting 10-25% of farmland in prairie strips can attract beneficial predators, improve soil nutrients, and boost yields by supporting pollinators and pest-controlling insects.\n\n2. Low Tilling: Reducing tillage and using cover crops can improve soil structure and support greater biodiversity above and below ground.\n\n3. Regenerative Grazing: Rotating livestock and using native plants, fire, and mowing can maintain healthy pastures and provide habitat for local species, especially in areas with prairie or forest ecosystems. \n\n4. Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Attracting beneficial insects through diverse plantings and cultural practices can reduce reliance on harmful pesticides.\n\n5. Conservation Easements: Partnering with land trusts to establish conservation easements can protect natural resources and provide tax benefits for farmers with large landholdings.\n\nImplementing these strategies, even partially, can have significant positive impacts on biodiversity and farm productivity by working with natural systems rather than against them. Experts emphasize that farming is as much for humans as it is a constant reminder of the laws of the natural world, and the more farmers can see their land as part of a larger ecosystem, the more sustainable their agriculture can become.",
