Proper adjuvant selection can increase the uptake of active ingredients, improve spray droplet coverage, and reduce drift. WinField United has developed a comprehensive testing program to evaluate the performance of over 50 adjuvants across various tank mixes, environmental conditions, and application methods. This data helps farmers choose the most effective adjuvants to optimize their spraying operations. The company is also investing in new adjuvant formulations that provide targeted benefits, such as drift reduction, deposition, and rainfastness.

      "summary": "Key Points:\n\n1. Farm Bill 2.0, also known as the Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2026, was released by House Agriculture Committee Chairman G.T. Thompson.\n\n2. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) welcomes the provisions in the bill that strengthen agriculture measures, including:\n   - Streamlining voluntary conservation programs\n   - Protecting grazing as a land management tool\n   - Addressing the shortage of rural veterinarians\n   - Establishing a 5-year pilot program to expand custom-exempt processing facilities and increase consumer access to locally raised beef\n\n3. The new bill builds on the accomplishments of the previous \"One, Big, Beautiful Bill\" (OBBB), which included:\n   - Expanded access to drought relief\n   - Depredation reimbursement\n   - Funding to protect the U.S. cattle herd from foreign animal diseases\n   - Increased estate tax exemption\n\n4. The bill aims to ensure the success of cattle producers by:\n   - Improving the implementation of conservation programs\n   - Expanding access to credit and increasing outdated agricultural loan limits\n   - Amending veterinary grant programs to relieve ongoing rural veterinary shortages\n   - Clarifying animal disease traceability eligibility under the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program (NADPRP)\n   - Establishing a 5-year pilot program to expand custom-exempt processing facilities and increase consumer access to locally raised beef\n\n5. NCBA President and Virginia cattle producer Gene Copenhaver, and NCBA Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Ethan Lane, both expressed strong support for the bill and urged the House and Senate to swiftly pass it to address the remaining legislative gaps facing animal agriculture.",

      "summary": "Bull sales are prevalent this time of year, with current sale averages setting records. Proper management of the bull investment is critical during the transition period.\n\nBulls are often overfed during the weaning to yearling stage to maximize their growth potential. This can lead to them being overconditioned, with a body condition score (BCS) of 7 or higher on a 1-9 scale. Overconditioned bulls can have fertility issues and lack the stamina for the breeding season.\n\nThe recommended BCS for bulls at the start of breeding is 6-6.5. To transition overconditioned bulls, a 90-day period is ideal. This allows time for the bull to adjust to new feeds and surroundings, as well as complete a spermatogenesis cycle to resolve any semen quality problems.\n\nWhen bringing in new bulls, a 2-4 week quarantine period is recommended for biosecurity. Gradual changes in diet are important, replacing concentrate with forage over several weeks. The target daily weight gain is 1.5-2 lbs, requiring access to high-quality forage (10% crude protein, 60-70% TDN).\n\nOther management strategies include providing an exercise area with fresh water, and avoiding rapid, dramatic changes. Knowing the bull's previous feeding program can also help ease the transition.\n\nThe article emphasizes the importance of proper bull management from sale to pasture to protect the breeding season investment and ensure herd fertility.",

Many other claims have been resolved through separate settlements.\n\n- If too many plaintiffs opt out, Monsanto has reserved the right to terminate the settlement without making payments.\n\n- Bayer has already removed glyphosate from Roundup products sold in the U.S. residential market and supports legislative efforts to limit litigation risk.",

Combined with over 2.15 billion bushels of beginning stocks, total supplies could top 18 billion bushels, keeping average prices near $4.33 per bushel.\n\nSoybean acres are forecast to rebound to 85 million, lifting production near 4.46 billion bushels. However, ending stocks near 370 million bushels could hold prices around $10.31 per bushel, despite stronger exports.\n\nWheat acreage is expected to remain historically low, but large global inventories will keep supplies comfortable. Prices may improve modestly to about $5.46 per bushel.\n\nSorghum faces the heaviest pressure, as large beginning stocks outweigh lower production, leaving prices near $3.69 per bushel unless Chinese demand strengthens.\n\nThe main takeaway for farmers is that large carryover stocks will limit upside potential for grain prices, despite solid yield forecasts.",

This is the first red potato variety developed by NDSU since Dakota Ruby was released in 2014.\n\nDakota Skarlagen was selected in 2012, evaluated from 2013 through 2025, and has been replicated in research trials and by farmers since 2017. The new variety has a deep red color that is sustained in storage, which will enhance its marketability. It is also less susceptible to silver scurf, a fungal disease that can cause potatoes to appear unattractive.\n\nThe new potato variety has smaller tubers than varieties like Red LaSota, but more of them per plant, resulting in competitive yields. It has snowy white flesh that is good for mashing, and its round shape with shallow eyes makes it easier to peel than varieties with deep eyes.\n\nSusie Thompson, NDSU associate professor and Johansen-Thompson Endowed Professor in potato breeding, believes the new variety is \"wonderful\" for both seed and commercial growers. Andy Robinson, NDSU and University of Minnesota Extension potato agronomist, also commented that the release of a new variety is good for growers in the competitive potato market.\n\nDuring the Northland Potato Growers Research Reporting Conference, potato growers also heard updates on insect management, particularly the ongoing challenge of controlling the Colorado potato beetle, which has developed resistance to various insecticides.",

      "summary": "Key Points:\n\n1. Harvestone Low Carbon Partners is exploring trucking carbon dioxide emissions from its Dakota Spirit ethanol plant near Jamestown, North Dakota, about 160 miles west for underground storage.\n\n2. The company requested a $20 million loan from North Dakota's Clean Sustainable Energy Authority (CSEA) in late January for its $95 million project, but the CSEA board voted against providing the funding.\n\n3. Harvestone already operates a carbon storage facility at its Blue Flint ethanol plant near Underwood, North Dakota, where the CO2 has been pumped underground into the Broom Creek Formation since 2023.\n\n4. Transporting CO2 by truck would not be a new practice, but the scale Harvestone is considering is. They plan to capture and store 230,000 metric tons of CO2 annually.\n\n5. Building a pipeline to transport Dakota Spirit's emissions would be expensive, as a 160-mile pipeline would only move about 1,430 metric tons of CO2 per mile, compared to Summit's 2,500-mile pipeline which would move about 7,200 metric tons per mile.\n\n6. Harvestone has an engineering, procurement and construction agreement with Minnesota-based McGough for the project, with a \"guaranteed substantial complete\" date in January 2027 and full commercial operations planned for later that year.\n\n7. The potential for carbon storage in eastern North Dakota is limited due to the area's geology, so some form of transportation would be needed if companies want to capture, store or use industrial emissions from the region.",

      "summary": "The study conducted in Rochester, Minnesota in 2025 evaluated how spray water pH adjustment and timing of spray solution mixing affected waterhemp control in a corn herbicide program. \n\nThe treatments included a tank mix of atrazine and Acuron GT (at full or half rate) with NIS and AMS, with or without a pH-lowering and buffering adjuvant (AlpHa Shot), and mixed either six days prior to application or at the time of spraying.\n\nAdding the pH-lowering adjuvant reduced spray water pH from 7.5 to 5.8, which improved waterhemp control by 10% at 24 days after treatment (DAT) and 7% at 112 DAT. Waterhemp density decreased by 64% and biomass was reduced by 55% in treatments with the pH adjuster.\n\nThe timing of mixing the pH adjuster (6 days ahead or at time of spraying) did not affect waterhemp control, density, or biomass. The improved weed control was observed at both full and half rates of Acuron GT.\n\nThe key takeaway is that conditioning the spray water to the proper pH can improve herbicide performance and season-long waterhemp management, regardless of when the solution is mixed. Testing water pH and using a water conditioner or buffering agent is recommended if waterhemp control has been inconsistent.\n\nThe study was conducted by Eric Yu and Ryan Miller, UMN Extension Crops Educators, and was published on February 17, 2026 in the UMN Crop News.",

Yields were similar across tillage/cover crop systems, with conventional tillage and strip-till averaging 78.4 bu/ac, no-till at 77.6 bu/ac, and no-till with cereal rye at 76.2 bu/ac. \n- While yields were comparable, differences in profitability emerged due to varying input costs. No-till had the highest partial net return, followed by strip-till and conventional tillage. No-till with cereal rye had the lowest partial net return due to cover crop management costs.\n- The study will continue in 2026 to track longer-term impacts on soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics in conservation systems.",

Other approaches include silvopasture (combining forestry and ranching) and alley cropping (using tree canopies to protect specialty crops).\n\nBenefits of forest farming include improved water and soil quality, increased carbon storage (up to 22 lbs per year), better temperature regulation, and the ability to grow specialized crops that thrive in forested environments. It supports biodiversity by providing habitat for beneficial insects, birds, mammals, fungi, and microbes.\n\nExisting forested land, riparian areas, and even small amounts of forest on a farm can be suitable for conversion to an agroforestry system. Before starting, farmers should inventory their natural resources, manage any invasive trees, and develop a forest management plan with help from extension services.\n\nMarketing forest crops often requires being proactive, as they may not fit typical farmer's market or restaurant sales channels.

      "summary": "Purdue researchers are adopting an interdisciplinary approach to assess the emerging tar spot disease in corn. The research team, led by C.D. Cruz, associate professor of botany and plant pathology, is using a mix of statistical, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, artificial intelligence, and computer vision methods to understand the dynamics of tar spot in corn.\n\nThe research is funded by two grants totaling nearly $1.1 million from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The team is collaborating with researchers from Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S.\n\nThe researchers have developed a digital method called the stromata contouring detection algorithm (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn. They have tested the algorithm under field conditions and found it to be successful in quantifying trends, but some inaccuracies persist in fully automated scenarios. The team is now refining their training methods to improve the model's accuracy and performance.\n\nAnother research effort includes the laboratory of Purdue's Mohammad Jahanshahi, associate professor in the Lyles School of Civil and Construction Engineering and the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Jahanshahi and Cruz, along with their students, are working on a proof-of-concept data fusion project that integrates drone imagery and weather data to capture crucial details about the tar spot pathosystem.\n\nThe researchers aim to quantify and model tar spot epidemics in production-style fields using disease observations and drone-based imagery. Ultimately, the team wants to quantify and model tar spot severity by referencing and integrating imagery with spatial and temporal data.\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of the project can place greater time demands on the researchers, but it also leads to better problem-solving as each person brings their own expertise to the table.",

Wheat condition is rated 79% good-to-excellent, higher than the 5-year average of 71%.\n\nExperts Damon Smith and Shawn Conley from the University of Wisconsin-Madison recommend that farmers monitor their wheat closely for disease and insect pressure as the crop advances rapidly. They advise applying fungicides at flag leaf emergence to protect against Fusarium head blight and other diseases.\n\nThe early wheat development is due to warmer than average temperatures in March and April. This accelerated growth could lead to earlier wheat harvest, potentially impacting management of other summer crops. Farmers should adjust plans accordingly and be prepared to shift fieldwork schedules as needed.",

      "summary": "Soybean fields may need replanting due to factors like freezing, hail, flooding, pests, and diseases. Before replanting, farmers should consider:\n\n1. Yield potential - Replanted soybeans may yield 5-10% less than the original stand. Yield loss is higher for replanting beyond June 1st.\n\n2. Maturity - Replanted soybeans will be 7-10 days later to maturity. This can impact harvest timing and drying costs.\n\n3. Weed control - Replanting provides a chance to change herbicide programs and manage weeds more effectively.\n\n4. Seed quality - Germination and vigor of replacement seed should be checked. Seed treatments may be needed.\n\n5. Planting date - Ideal replanting dates are before June 1st in northern climates. Yields drop significantly for plantings after June 15th.\n\n6. Stand uniformity - Uneven stands can impact harvestability and yield. Aim for a uniform 100,000-150,000 plants/acre.\n\nShawn P. Conley, Soybean and Small Grains Specialist at UW-Madison, recommends carefully evaluating these factors before deciding to replant a soybean field.",
