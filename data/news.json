The farmer's cap is highlighted as one of the dirtiest pieces of a farmer's daily attire, as they tend to wear the same cap repeatedly without washing it.\n\nKey details:\n- Farmers, like mechanics, miners, plumbers, veterinarians, and daycare workers, produce a lot of dirty laundry through their work.\n- When the author's twin boys were babies, a single night of sickness led to a huge new load of laundry, foreshadowing the boys' future as farmers.\n- Farmer's caps are often the dirtiest part of a farmer's outfit, as they wear the same comfortable cap repeatedly without washing it.\n- Farmers tend to hoard \"free\" caps obtained through seed/equipment purchases, and will stubbornly search for a lost, dirty cap rather than use a clean replacement.\n- The author describes a lively discussion with her husband's family about the proper way to dry a freshly laundered farmer's cap, with the common method being to shape it around a sauce pan.\n\nThe article provides a humorous but insightful look into the laundry challenges faced by farmers due to the nature of their work.

This is early in the seasonal cash price highs that typically happen in the first or second week of March. \n\nThe article notes that while cattle numbers are tight and demand is good, the large carcass weights are a downfall for leverage. On Friday, the market initially spiked higher on the strong cash prices, but then slipped after President Trump signed an executive order to quadruple the amount of beef imported from Argentina, which was a surprise as it was only expected to double.\n\nThe article states that while beef prices being too high is still in the news, the author believes the market should be allowed to fix itself. Overall, it was a volatile, \"whiplash\" week for the cattle markets.",

However, it also made the plants more susceptible to \"iron toxicity\" where the plant absorbs too much iron, reducing productivity and causing some crops to die.\n\n- To address this, the team plans to modify the same genes in rice varieties grown in aerated soil, as iron is less easily accessed by the plant in this type of soil. They also intend to modify the genes in other crops like wheat, barley, sorghum, and maize that are not prone to iron toxicity.\n\n- The researchers hope their approach can help create more nutrient-dense food to address iron deficiencies worldwide.",

The product is not approved to treat active screwworm infestations and is authorized solely for prevention.\n\nKey restrictions include a 35-day slaughter withdrawal period, no established milk discard time (prohibited for lactating dairy cows), and not authorized for calves processed for veal. Ivomec remains approved for other labeled uses in cattle, swine, reindeer, and American bison.\n\nThe FDA acknowledged that while available evidence supports the reasonable belief that Ivomec may be effective in preventing screwworm infestations, effectiveness may vary depending on environmental conditions, infestation pressure, and potential antiparasitic resistance. Producers are encouraged to work with veterinarians to integrate Ivomec into a broader parasite management strategy.\n\nThe EUA follows a broader federal effort to prevent the reintroduction of New World screwworm into the United States, which could have serious animal health, economic, and trade consequences for the U.S. livestock industry. The emergency authorization will remain in effect until it is revoked or until the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines that the public health emergency related to New World screwworm no longer exists.",

      "summary": "S. agriculture industry. Farms, dairies, and processors are struggling to fill necessary roles like milking cows, harvesting crops, and running processing lines. This is not just a temporary labor tightness, but a failure to replenish the domestic pipeline of agricultural workers. Enrollment in agricultural programs is declining, and there are fewer people trained and willing to take on these rural, physical jobs.\n\nThe article notes this is not simply a wage issue, as many of these jobs offer steady pay, benefits, and security. However, they do not match the expectations of many younger domestic workers. Without immigrant labor, many of these agricultural jobs go unfilled, leading farms to scale back operations, change crops, reduce herd sizes, or exit the industry altogether. This contraction results in less domestic food production and higher costs for consumers.\n\nThe article argues that what agriculture needs is a legal, reliable, and well-managed immigrant workforce that can be planned around and retained. In 2023, foreign-born workers made up 18.6% of the civilian labor force, or 29.9 million people employed, who paid $651.9 billion in U.S. taxes. Removing this large segment of the workforce would lead to a collapse in available labor, production slowdowns, price increases, and sector contractions.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on agriculture, the article also discusses the implications for Social Security. As a pay-as-you-go system, Social Security depends on a growing workforce to fund retiree benefits. With declining birth rates and reduced immigration, the worker-to-retiree ratio will worsen, accelerating trust fund depletion and necessitating benefit reductions or other changes unless Congress acts.\n\nThe article concludes that immigration is not just a labor issue, but a retirement, fiscal, and food security issue. Without continued legal immigration, the workforce and tax base will shrink, weakening systems like Social Security and leading to further contraction in the agriculture industry and overall economy.",

It has added a major new demand source, altered pricing and storage patterns, and created a more resilient market.\n\n2. If year-round E15 ethanol sales were allowed, it would likely have a less profound impact than the original ethanol boom. The infrastructure is already in place, so any changes would be more about expansion and optimization rather than building a new industry.\n\n3. Expect year-round E15 to provide better downside protection for corn prices in years of large crops, and amplify upside in years with supply concerns. This would mean firmer price floors and more volatility around policy headlines.\n\n4. Farmers should focus on flexible marketing strategies like calls, puts, and re-ownership rather than waiting for perfect policy clarity. Disciplined marketing will be key in this headline-driven market.\n\n5. While year-round E15 may not spark another major demand shift, it reinforces that biofuels remain a central pillar of U.S. corn demand that can expand rather than just shuffle existing use.\n\n6. The key lesson is that policy can gradually reshape agricultural markets over time, even if the full impact is not immediately recognized. Respecting this trend is more important than chasing every headline.",

      "summary": "S. and Chinese presidents, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, had a \"very positive\" call discussing Taiwan and soybeans as part of efforts to ease U.S.-China tensions. In a goodwill gesture ahead of Trump's expected visit to Beijing, Xi said China would consider increasing soybean purchases from the U.S. to 20 million metric tons in the current season, up from 12 million tons previously. This sent soybean futures higher.\n\nThe call also covered trade, security issues, and other areas of tension between the two countries, including Taiwan arms sales and investigations into senior Chinese military leaders. Both leaders emphasized the importance of maintaining strong U.S.-China relations. \n\nKey details:\n- Soybean purchases could increase from 12 million to 20 million metric tons\n- Soybean futures rallied over 3% to a two-month high\n- Experts say U.S. soybean supplies may not be sufficient to meet the additional Chinese demand without impacting other importers\n- The U.S. announced a $11.1 billion arms sale to Taiwan in December, angering China\n- Investigations into Chinese military leaders have raised concerns about foreign policy implications\n- The leaders also discussed Iran, the Russia-Ukraine war, airplane engines, and oil and gas\n\nThe summary captures the main news, key numbers/statistics, dates, names of people/organizations, locations, context, impacts for farmers, and expert commentary from the original article.",

The new MALC facility will bring the Jersey cows back to the Columbus campus.\n\nThe $XX million MALC project broke ground on January 30, 2024 and the ribbon cutting was held on January 29, 2026. The new dairy will provide hands-on learning opportunities for students, potentially in agricultural engineering, to service robotic dairy systems.\n\nOhio is an important dairy state, ranking 12th nationally in milk production. It is 1st in Swiss cheese production, and dairy is typically the 3rd or 4th largest agricultural sector. Ohio has about 252,000 dairy cows across 1,400 herds, with 278 robotic milking systems installed so far.\n\nThe new MALC and dairy farm aim to advance the sustainability of food production and showcase modern dairy farming technology and practices to the local community.",

Warm-season perennials may not work well for a July reseeding, but summer annuals like sudangrass, sorghum-sudangrass, pearl millet, and teff grass can be good options.\n- For August/September reseedings, oats, triticale, and annual ryegrass are recommended to graze or harvest in the spring.\n- Grasses and legumes each provide different benefits - grasses reduce erosion while legumes add nitrogen and can increase carrying capacity, but must be balanced to avoid issues like grass tetany or bloat.\n- Key preparation steps include soil testing/amendments, weed control, using high-quality seed, inoculating legumes, suppressing existing vegetation, calibrating equipment, and planting the best crop for the timing.\n- Farmers should leverage resources and have conversations to develop a thorough plan for dealing with unscheduled pipeline easement work.",

      "summary": "The goal was to determine if growers can maintain soybean productivity and profitability using reduced tillage and cover crops, which protect soil but are often perceived as risky.\n\nThe study looked at 4 management systems: conventional tillage (CT), strip-tillage (ST), no-tillage (NT), and no-tillage with a cereal rye cover crop (NT+CR). Each system was paired with 3 starter fertilizer strategies: unfertilized control, 15 lb N/ac, and 15 lb N/ac + 10 lb S/ac.\n\nKey findings:\n- Starter fertilizer increased early-season soybean biomass by ~12% but did not significantly impact final yields.\n- Soybean yields ranged from 60-95 bu/ac across sites, with no significant differences between tillage systems (CT/ST averaged 78.4 bu/ac, NT 77.6 bu/ac, NT+CR 76.2 bu/ac).\n- While yields were similar, reduced tillage systems had higher partial net returns due to lower operational costs.\n- The higher costs of the cereal rye cover crop resulted in the lowest partial net returns for NT+CR, though cost-share programs can offset this.\n\nThe project will continue in 2026 to track medium-term responses as the soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics change under the conservation systems.",

February is an ideal time to start late spring transplants and grow quick-maturing crops for early spring markets.\n\nGreenhouse Basics:\n- Greenhouses trap thermal heat to warm plants, with some offering vents, climate controls, and irrigation systems.\n- Modular plastic greenhouses can raise temperatures up to 30°F higher. Low tunnels can raise temperatures 2-15°F, while cold frames can raise it 5-15°F.\n- Well-designed greenhouses with climate controls allow year-round growing.\n\nWhat to Grow:\n- Tomatoes and peppers benefit from early indoor planting, needing consistent warmth (at least 50°F) to germinate.\n- Brassicas like kale, cabbage, and cauliflower can be grown indoors to avoid pests and extreme cold.\n- Lettuces, potatoes, onions, and many flowers can also get a head start in the greenhouse.\n\nThe article provides guidance on selecting the right greenhouse type based on your climate and growing needs. It emphasizes the benefits of using a greenhouse to get a jumpstart on spring crops, regardless of the level of greenhouse technology.",

      "summary": "According to the data, the coldest temperatures reached in January 2026 were around -20°F in the southern and central parts of the state, and below -30°F in the northeast.\n\nFor soybean aphids, the article predicts very little mortality (0-50%) in the southern half of the state and the Red River Valley, but 50-95% mortality in north-central and northeast Minnesota. This is an improvement over the extremely mild winter of 2024, but not as favorable as the strong polar vortex in 2019 which caused up to 90% aphid mortality.\n\nFor alfalfa weevil, the article states that with soil temperatures only reaching a minimum of 15.4°F at one location, not much mortality is expected this year. Northern areas with less snow cover may see slight reductions in alfalfa weevil pressure.\n\nCorn rootworm forecasting is more complex, as their eggs overwinter in the soil. At the coldest 4 and 8-inch soil temperatures recorded (-19.4°F and -23.0°F), not much acute mortality is expected. Rootworm mortality depends on both temperature and duration of exposure.\n\nEmerald ash borer, while not a field crop pest, was also discussed. The article predicts 25% or more mortality in the northern half of the state after accounting for the insulation provided by ash tree bark.\n\nThe article recommends that farmers be proactive about scouting for soybean aphids this year, and consider aphid-resistant soybean varieties if available. No other specific recommendations for farmers are provided.",

This is attributed to lower than expected soybean yields in the Midwest due to drought conditions.\n\nCorn prices have also risen by 5%, now averaging $4.75 per bushel, due to similar crop challenges in major corn-producing states.\n\nThe USDA forecasts an overall 4% decline in total crop production for 2026 compared to the previous year. This is expected to impact farm incomes, which are projected to drop by an average of 7% across the country.\n\nThe American Farm Bureau is urging Congress to expand crop insurance programs and disaster relief funding to help offset these losses for farmers. Spokesperson Mary Johnson emphasized the importance of supporting family farms during these challenging times.\n\nWeather forecasts indicate the drought conditions may persist through the summer, raising concerns about the 2027 growing season as well. Farmers are advised to explore water conservation techniques and drought-resistant crop varieties.\n\nThe Agriculture Today podcast provides regular updates on these industry trends and issues impacting the agricultural community.",

      "summary": "Key points:\n\n- Cotton wholesalers serve retail channels that would otherwise struggle to source product efficiently, such as independent stores, regional chains, uniform programs, and workwear accounts. These retailers often lack the scale or capital to buy directly from factories.\n\n- Wholesalers break large production runs into smaller, manageable assortments and replenishment programs, keeping these outlets viable. They also democratize access to compliance, traceability, and quality standards.\n\n- Without wholesalers, retail assortments would narrow, buying would become more conservative, and out-of-stocks would increase. This would reduce cotton's retail footprint and concentrate demand among fewer players, increasing vulnerability across the supply chain.\n\n- The article cites expert Bob Antoshak, who states that this \"long tail\" of retail plays a meaningful role in sustaining cotton consumption.\n\n- The key takeaway for farmers is that wholesale distribution helps sustain the diversity of cotton demand.",
