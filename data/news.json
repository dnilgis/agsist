It involved interviews with 64 community leaders who work closely with farmers. The study was funded by the CDC, USDA, and Nationwide Insurance.",

      "summary": "The U.S. egg industry is implementing a growth strategy to expand egg exports, starting with Indonesia. The strategy aims to diversify supply distribution and offset domestic market conditions by 2026. \n\nThe plan was kick-started by a USDA trade mission to Jakarta. The American Egg Board (AEB) is leading the export growth effort, with a goal of increasing U.S. egg exports to Indonesia from the current 2% market share to 10% by 2026.\n\nIndonesia's egg consumption is expected to grow by 4.2% annually, reaching 3.4 million metric tons by 2026. The U.S. currently exports about 2% of its egg production, but the industry wants to double that to 4% by 2026 through expanded trade with Indonesia and other markets.\n\nKey factors driving the export push include oversupply in the domestic U.S. market, with 10% more eggs produced than consumed in 2022. Egg prices dropped 40% from record highs in 2022. Exports could help stabilize the U.S. egg market and support farmer incomes.\n\nThe AEB is working to overcome trade barriers, improve supply chain logistics, and promote U.S. egg quality and safety in Indonesia. Recommendations include building relationships with Indonesian importers and distributors, and addressing regulatory requirements.",

The family has a total of 31 children, with 28 being adopted. \n\nTo enable Elijah to compete in the visually demanding event of breakaway roping, the family worked with the rodeo association to get approval for a lighted collar on the calves, which helps Elijah see them. Elijah's older siblings and friends also provide guidance and positioning assistance during his runs.\n\nDespite many missed attempts, Elijah's persistence paid off, and his first successful catch was celebrated by the entire rodeo community. The article highlights how the rodeo family has rallied to support Elijah and help him achieve this milestone.\n\nThe article provides the following key details:\n- Elijah's visual condition of coloboma, which causes blacked out areas in his vision\n- The Faske family's adoption story and their 31 children, 28 of whom are adopted\n- Elijah's progression in riding and roping, starting with a blind horse and working up to his current mount, Catolena\n- The process of getting approval for the lighted calf collar from the regional, state, and national rodeo organizations\n- Quotes from Elijah's mother, Suzanne, describing the family's approach and the community support\n\nThe article emphasizes how Elijah's achievement, made possible through adaptation and persistence, has redefined \"access\" in the sport of rodeo.",

Adoption is growing, with 50% of cattle farmers expected to use electronic ID tags by 2025.\n\nThe technology can enable participation in value-added certification programs that offer price premiums. One program, Superior Plus, provides an extra $2-3 per hundredweight for calves sold with electronic IDs.\n\nImplementing electronic ID systems typically costs $10-15 per head upfront. But farmers can recoup this investment through improved herd management, better breeding decisions, and premium prices from value-added programs.\n\nExperts recommend farmers start by piloting the technology on a portion of their herd to test the benefits before full-scale adoption.

      "summary": "S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in July 2025 is a major concern for Canada's consul general, as trade predictability is crucial for Minnesota's agricultural industry. Beth Richardson, Canada's consul general in Minneapolis, stated that if the USMCA is renewed for 16 more years, it would provide the much-needed predictability for businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nThe three countries combined account for around $1.8 trillion in annual trade, making it one of the most integrated economic regions globally. Agriculture is a central part of this relationship, particularly in the Upper Midwest, where cross-border supply chains are constantly in motion.\n\nAndrea Vaubel, the deputy commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, emphasized the importance of stability, noting the state's position as a major producer of livestock, grain, and specialty crops. Richardson said the successful review of the USMCA would be a positive signal for restoring confidence across the supply chain.\n\nThe article also highlighted the impact of tariff uncertainty, such as the briefly imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports of steel and aluminum last February, which affected the affordability of potash, a critical fertilizer for farmers. Richardson and Vaubel stressed that unpredictability is the most challenging aspect for producers and agribusinesses.\n\nAlejandra Bologna, the head consul of Mexico in St. Paul, stated that 85% of the goods traded between Mexico and the U.S. are under the USMCA treatment and are not affected by tariffs. She also noted that trade between the two countries has increased tenfold since 1994, demonstrating the deep economic integration within the North American region.\n\nThe article provided examples of the integration, such as Canada supplying over 90% of the oats used by U.S. food processing facilities, and the U.S. importing nearly 7 million hogs from Canada each year for processing and genetics, while also exporting processed pork back to Canada.\n\nOverall, the key takeaways are the importance of trade predictability, the need to avoid tariff uncertainty, the deep economic integration within the North American region, and the mutually dependent agricultural relationship between Canada and Minnesota.",

      "summary": "This decision was made by Doug Burgum, the Department of Interior Secretary appointed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 governs the use of these federal lands, and its purpose includes supporting the economic viability of nearby livestock operations and rural communities. However, various conservation groups had been working to \"rewild\" the Northern Great Plains region by buying up ranches and replacing cattle with bison.\n\nThe APR had purchased ranches in Montana's Phillips County and applied to the local BLM office to change the grazing permits to allow year-round bison grazing, removing interior fences. This faced strong opposition from local ranchers and organizations, who then hired lawyer Karen Budd-Falen to sue the BLM.\n\nA former BLM Range Specialist, Roy Taylor, documented numerous instances where the APR violated BLM regulations, which he shared with the public. He collaborated with Sierra Stoneberg Holt to organize this information. This evidence appears to have contributed to the BLM's decision to rescind the APR's grazing permits.\n\nThe article states this is a victory for President Trump's common-sense approach to staffing government agencies. The change in grazing permits is expected to have a positive impact on the economic viability of nearby livestock operations and rural communities in the Northern Great Plains region.",

      "summary": "S. beef herd has not yet recovered, with a 1% national decline and a 30,000 head drop in Texas' herd, the nation's largest beef producer. However, Texas producers held back 50,000 more heifers for future herd growth, an 8% increase in replacements.\n\nExperts anticipate a slower cattle herd rebuild and tighter cattle supplies that will impact prices throughout the supply chain. Calf prices are already high, with 500-600 lb steers averaging $450/cwt in Texas compared to $326/cwt last year. Cow-calf producer margins are expected to remain strong, potentially even better than last year, due to lower feed costs and sustained demand.\n\nThe rebuilding process appears more measured than past post-drought recoveries, with high bred-heifer values of $4,000-$5,000 incentivizing some producers to sell rather than retain for herd growth. Texas' long-term cattle capacity has also been reduced by urban expansion, land fragmentation, and conversion to non-agricultural uses.\n\nEmerging drought in Texas could further influence producer decisions. Experts expect calf prices to go even higher in 2026-2027 due to the tightened supplies, though the year's outlook will depend heavily on drought conditions.\n\nThe recent winter storm across Texas brought freezing temperatures, snow, and ice, posing significant challenges for livestock producers. While cattle were generally in fair to good condition, some losses were reported, and supplemental feeding was widespread. The extreme weather also delayed fieldwork and impacted crop conditions, especially for winter wheat.",

This news was welcomed by the biofuels and soybean industry.\n\nThe 45Z program, created under President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and amended last year under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, gives soybean oil a better standing with a higher credit, going from 30 cents per gallon to 60 cents per gallon.\n\nTom Verry, the director of outreach and development for Clean Fuels Alliance America, stated that the guidance will kickstart an industry that has been in a state of limbo for the last year. The tax credit is projected to result in a record use of 15.5 billion pounds of soybean oil in biofuels this year, more than half of U.S. production.\n\nScott Metzger, the American Soybean Association (ASA) President and Ohio farmer, expressed excitement about the credit news, stating that it will help build domestic markets for U.S. soybeans. Steve Censky, the ASA CEO, also noted that the credit news should be paired with finalizing the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) blending targets to complement the work of the Treasury and Congress.\n\nThe clean fuel production credit provides businesses an income tax credit for clean transportation fuel produced domestically after December 31, 2024, and sold by December 31, 2029. The guidance also proposes rules to implement certain changes to the credit brought on by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",

      "summary": "The Hiroshima University-led project has secured a $1.8 million grant from the Gates Foundation to develop a way to store bull semen using simple refrigeration instead of costly liquid nitrogen. This technology could remove a major barrier to modern dairy cattle breeding that has long excluded farmers in low-resource regions.\n\nThe project, headed by Professor Masayuki Shimada, builds on the team's 2019 discovery that identified functional differences between X-bearing (female-producing) and Y-bearing (male-producing) sperm. They developed a simplified and low-cost sex selection technique that helps farmers reliably produce more female calves. This technique has already been deployed at dairy farming sites in India.\n\nHowever, expanding the technology's use globally requires a safe method of transporting and storing the processed sperm. The new grant will allow the team to develop a storage method that allows bovine sperm to be stored at about 5 degrees Celsius, eliminating the need for liquid nitrogen. This could make artificial insemination much easier to use.\n\nThe project is being carried out in collaboration with agricultural organizations and government-affiliated research institutes in India, along with research groups within Hiroshima University. The technology is expected to increase milk production, stabilize incomes for small-scale dairy farmers, and improve children's nutritional status in regions like India and Africa.\n\nShimada's laboratory already hosts doctoral students from government agencies in countries where the technology is expected to roll out, including Nigeria, Mozambique, and Bangladesh. A framework is also in place to train local experts and roll out the technology on the ground.",

Adjuvants help improve the effectiveness and reduce the drift of herbicides, making them critical for compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nThe increased emphasis on adjuvants has significant implications for farmers. They will now need to factor in the cost of adjuvants, which can range from $3 to $15 per acre, into their weed management budgets. Additionally, farmers must carefully select the appropriate adjuvant for each herbicide to ensure optimal performance and drift reduction.\n\nManufacturers of adjuvants, such as Corteva Agriscience and Winfield United, are responding to the EPA's new strategy by developing new and improved adjuvant products. These companies are working to provide farmers with the necessary tools to meet the EPA's drift reduction requirements.\n\nThe EPA's Herbicide Strategy is part of its broader efforts to address the issue of pesticide drift, which can have negative impacts on neighboring crops, sensitive habitats, and human health. By elevating the role of adjuvants, the EPA aims to empower farmers to better manage drift and comply with regulatory requirements.",

This was part of a pilot project with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.\n\nThe Blairs' system stores water in a pond and pumps it through an irrigation pivot on 125 acres. While recent rains have limited their ability to test the full impact, Iowa State data has shown yield increases from the system. Experts like Chris Hay of Hay Water Solutions say the system can provide a 3-inch supplemental water supply during dry summer periods.\n\nAn economic analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund found drainage water recycling can boost crop yield income by $130-$146 per acre annually, while saving $10-$20 per acre in operating costs. The practice also provides water quality benefits by reducing nutrient runoff.\n\nHowever, these systems require a significant upfront investment of $2-$3 million, plus ongoing maintenance. Experts recommend having a pond that can store 4-6 inches of water for the irrigated area. Funding will likely require both private farmer investment and public/outside support.\n\nThe Blairs advise other farmers interested in this to seek local help and expertise to plan and implement the system.

      "summary": "An estimated 1.48 billion chicken wings will be consumed around the Super Bowl, which would circle the Earth's equator more than 3 times if laid end-to-end. \n\nWholesale wing prices are $1.12 per pound, up from 99 cents per pound earlier this year, but well below the $1.99 per pound last year, $2.65 in 2024, and $3.80 in 2022. This is due to increased poultry production, even as wings remain a hugely popular Super Bowl snack.\n\nThe article cites Texas A&M AgriLife Extension economist David Anderson, who says wings have become a cultural tradition for the Super Bowl, similar to hot dogs on the 4th of July. He notes that wing production is limited by animal physiology, but overall U.S. production this year is estimated at 17.5 billion wings, with about 8.5% consumed just during the Super Bowl.\n\nAnderson says the Super Bowl represents the pinnacle of chicken wing demand each year, and that he will personally be making wings to enjoy for the big game.",
