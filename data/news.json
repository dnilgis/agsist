Key findings:\n\n- 87% of consumers believe regenerative agriculture practices are important, but only 31% are familiar with the term.\n- Consumers most associate regenerative agriculture with practices like improved soil health (53%), reduced chemical inputs (49%), and increased biodiversity (43%).  \n- The top benefits consumers see from regenerative agriculture are improved environmental impact (67%), better food quality (59%), and improved animal welfare (53%).\n- 68% of consumers say they would pay more for products from farms using regenerative practices, with an average premium of 24% they are willing to pay.\n- Consumers most trust information about regenerative agriculture from farmers (68%), environmental organizations (58%), and government agencies (49%).\n\nThe study underscores the opportunity for farmers to educate consumers and capitalize on growing demand for regenerative products. Experts recommend that farmers highlight specific regenerative practices and their benefits to differentiate their products in the marketplace.",

This ability to better metabolize casein gives S. aureus a competitive advantage in the nutrient-rich environment of the cow's udder, enabling the bacteria to thrive and cause persistent mastitis infections.\n\nThe findings highlight the importance of continued monitoring and research to understand how mastitis-causing pathogens are adapting over time. This knowledge can inform more effective prevention and treatment strategies to help dairy farmers combat this economically damaging disease.",

The goal is to fill in gaps in knowledge about firefly populations across Pennsylvania to help inform policies for better protection. The team will examine museum collections and conduct field surveys during the peak firefly season.\n\nThe inventory will focus on areas like the Allegheny National Forest, which is known for high firefly populations. Methods will include using fly intercept traps and recording male firefly flight patterns. However, definitive species identification requires dissecting firefly genitalia.\n\nThe inventory is prompted by concerns about potential firefly declines, as they are becoming harder to find outside of protected natural areas. Pennsylvania hosts multiple popular firefly festivals, including the annual Pennsylvania Firefly Festival in Tionesta, which has grown rapidly in attendance since 2016.\n\nOrganizers Peggy and Ken Butler now use a lottery system to limit the festival to 75 attendees for two nighttime tours. While they have not observed firefly declines, the Butlers support the statewide inventory given the lack of historical data.

It was released in February 2026.\n\nThe authors believe the current industrial food system provides more nutritious, varied, fresh, and affordable options than ever before. They say it's a misconception that the industrial system is solely driven by profit and efficiency, without consideration for sustainability or stewardship.\n\nRosenberg, an associate professor at Duke University, has expertise in rural history and the history of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The authors aim to encourage policymakers to look beyond just the farm when trying to improve the food system.\n\nThe authors define \"industrial\" food as being scalable and standardized in inputs and outputs, rather than relying on alternative methods like organic or local production. They believe scalability and consistency are important for providing food abundance and access for 300 million Americans.\n\nWhile the authors don't dismiss the value of some organic or regenerative practices, they argue that an overemphasis on these ideological labels can divert from practical, outcome-driven solutions. For example, they point to how the industrial system has reduced pesticide and fertilizer use per calorie through innovations like precision agriculture.\n\nThe key is continuing to apply smart innovations and common-sense policies to further improve the industrial food system, rather than automatically favoring small-scale, local alternatives, according to the authors.",

Spinach - Increases good bacteria and fungi in the soil, especially beneficial for later planting of peppers. Requires soil temperature of at least 40°F.\n\n2. Kale - Feeds the soil, people, livestock, and can be a specialty market crop. Needs slightly warmer soil of at least 45°F. Resistant varieties recommended in disease-prone areas.\n\n3. Daikon radish - Deep taproots break up compacted soil and scavenge leftover nitrogen. Requires soil temperature of at least 65°F.\n\n4. Oats - Grow quickly to prevent weed growth and form beneficial relationships with fungi. Can be sown with peas for nitrogen fixing. Tolerate temperatures down to 20°F.\n\n5. Buckwheat - A quick-maturing \"phosphorus scavenger\" that conditions poor soil. Can be used as a mulch after flowering.\n\nFarmers should consider their local climate and use low tunnels if needed to provide extra warmth and protection for the cover crops during cold weather. Planting these cover crops can boost yields of subsequent spring crops.",

This will allow the current site next to Falls Park to be redeveloped.\n\nSmithfield, the city's 4th largest employer with over 3,100 workers, plans to open the new modern plant in Foundation Park near Interstates 90 and 29. Smithfield CEO Shane Smith called it a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\" for Sioux Falls, employees, and agriculture.\n\nThe current Smithfield plant (formerly John Morrell & Co.) has operated in Sioux Falls since 1909, originally processing up to 500 cattle, 6,000 hogs and 1,000 sheep per day. The company was founded in England in 1827 and expanded to the U.S. in 1864. \n\nThere has been significant labor strife at the plant over the years, including a sit-down strike in 1935 that led to the National Guard being mobilized. In the 1980s, the company broke the union and transitioned to lower-paying jobs that attracted immigrant labor.\n\nSmithfield acquired the plant in 1995 when it purchased John Morrell & Co. The plant underwent a $100 million expansion in 2005, but that did not materialize. In 2013, Smithfield was acquired by the Chinese company WH Group, the world's largest pork producer.",

Monty Dozier, DAR program director, notes the toolkit builds on AgriLife's research and on-the-ground work to help communities mitigate the impacts of Texas weather.\n\nThe toolkit is part of DAR's broader effort to support long-term disaster mitigation, rather than just disaster response.

Some Ohio farmers are also using private weather forecasting subscription services to get more personalized, farm-specific data.\n\nDuane Stateler, a crop and hog farmer in northwestern Ohio, has used a private weather forecasting service for 14 years. His service, BAMwx.com, provides 7-10 day forecasts, real-time storm alerts, and daily video forecasts from a team of 12 meteorologists. Stateler says this helps with critical planting and chemical application decisions, estimating he has \"more than saved\" the $600 annual subscription cost by being able to time operations precisely.\n\nThe article notes that other agricultural forecasting tools are also emerging, such as Ranchbot for pasture management, and companies like Tempest and DTN using public data and machine learning to deliver hyper-local forecasts. \n\nOhio State Extension plans to install mesonet weather stations in all 88 counties by 2025, providing public data to improve disease/pest scouting alerts, crop modeling, and temperature monitoring for farmers.\n\nAaron Wilson, an OSU Extension climate specialist, says short-term forecasting is most reliable 3-5 days out, so denser data networks are key to increasing accuracy for agricultural needs like planting windows and drought monitoring.",

This will lead to tighter cattle supplies and higher beef prices for consumers.\n\n- Cattle prices are expected to average $160-$170 per cwt in 2026, up from $155 per cwt in 2025. Calf prices are forecast to average $220-$240 per cwt.\n\n- Drought conditions have persisted across the Southern Plains, impacting pasture and feed availability. This has contributed to the herd liquidation.\n\n- Randy Blach advised cattle producers to carefully manage their herds and expenses given the market volatility. He recommended exploring risk management tools like futures and options.\n\n- The National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) is working to promote beef demand both domestically and internationally to offset the tighter supply.\n\n- Blach expects the beef industry to remain profitable overall in 2026, though profitability may be squeezed for cow-calf producers dealing with higher feed costs.",

Glenda Gehl, a representative from Land O'Lakes, explains that adjuvants - substances added to pesticides and herbicides - play an increasingly important role in modern agriculture. \n\nAdjuvants can improve spray coverage, droplet size, and penetration, leading to more effective and efficient pesticide and herbicide applications. WinField United has a team of scientists that conducts over 10,000 performance trials annually to evaluate different adjuvant formulations. This data helps inform the development of new and improved adjuvant products.\n\nOne new adjuvant, Unite, was recently introduced by WinField United. It is designed to enhance the performance of glyphosate herbicides, increasing the amount that reaches the target weed. Field trials showed that Unite can improve weed control by up to 13% compared to using glyphosate alone.\n\nGehl emphasizes that selecting the right adjuvant is crucial for farmers to get the most out of their pesticide and herbicide applications. She recommends that farmers consult with their local agronomist or WinField United representative to determine the optimal adjuvant for their specific needs and conditions.",

Key details:\n\n- The bill text largely reflects the Republican proposal from 2024, but faces opposition from Democrats who have vowed to block the bill.\n- The bill proposes revamping the existing farm safety net programs, including crop insurance, commodity subsidies, and conservation programs.\n- Republican leaders aim to cut spending on food stamps (SNAP) by $20 billion over 10 years, a move opposed by Democrats.\n- The bill would expand crop insurance premium subsidies and increase payment limits for commodity programs.\n- It would also consolidate conservation programs and direct more funding towards regional conservation partnerships.\n- Farmers have been calling for overdue investments in the agricultural sector, but the partisan divide makes the bill's passage uncertain.\n\nNo specific expert quotes or impacts on farmers were provided in the article summary. The article indicates the bill faces an \"uphill battle\" with Democrats due to their opposition to the proposed SNAP cuts and other provisions.",

Sandy soils are less ideal as they don't expand/contract as much during freeze-thaw.\n\n- Adequate spring moisture is vital for establishing a healthy stand after frost seeding. The success of frost seeded stands depends significantly on spring moisture levels.\n\n- The author is Dr. Shelby Gruss, an assistant professor and forage extension specialist who joined Iowa State University in November 2023.

Slow-growing herbs like basil and rosemary, which take 1 week to 1 month to germinate.\n2. Tomatoes, which need 80+ days from seed to fruit. Opt for determinate varieties in short seasons or indeterminate for year-round harvests.\n3. Peppers, which can take up to 1 month to sprout and need 2+ months to mature. Choose productive varieties like jalapeño, serrano, or shishito.\n4. Brassicas like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale, which thrive in cool weather. Leafy types mature quickly, while heading types need more tending.\n5. Lettuce, which can handle some late frost and is easy to start directly sown or in trays.\n6. Carrots and parsnips, which need to be direct sown due to their sensitive taproots.\n7. Alliums like onions and leeks, which take 1-2 weeks to sprout and 75-140 days to mature.\n\nThe article notes that February is the right time to start these crops, as they either take a long time to mature, are slow to germinate, or prefer the cool conditions of early spring. Proper growing setups like greenhouses and cold frames can protect these plants until the weather warms.",

Each system was paired with 3 starter fertilizer strategies: unfertilized control, 15 lb N/ac, and 15 lb N/ac + 10 lb S/ac.\n\nKey findings:\n- Starter fertilizer increased soybean biomass by ~12% at V4 stage, but did not significantly impact yields.\n- Soybean yields ranged from 60-95 bu/ac across locations. Yields were similar between CT/ST (78.4 bu/ac) and NT (77.6 bu/ac), with NT+CR being slightly lower at 76.2 bu/ac.\n- While yields were comparable, the no-till systems had higher partial net returns due to lower operational costs.\n- The NT+CR system had the lowest partial net return due to the higher cost of cover crop management, estimated at $55/ac.\n\nThe project will continue in 2026 to track medium-term responses as the soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics change under the conservation systems.

      "summary": "Winter sowing involves starting seeds in containers like milk jugs or plastic bags and placing them outdoors, where the cold, moist conditions help the seeds break dormancy. This results in hardier transplants that mature sooner than they would otherwise.\n\nThe best vegetables for winter sowing include hardy greens like kale and cabbage, as well as spinach, onions, and leafy greens like chard and watercress. These plants can handle cold temperatures in their early stages.\n\nFor flowers, the article recommends sowing perennials like pansies, echinacea, snapdragons, larkspur, and scabiosa. Many of these need a period of cold stratification, which the winter sowing method provides.\n\nSpecific varieties mentioned include 'Carex' cabbage for shorter maturation, 'Avon' spinach for mildew resistance, and different groups of snapdragons suited to varying light and heat conditions.\n\nThe article notes that winter sowing offers the benefits of direct sowing with less risk, and provides a natural way to break dormancy for plants that require cold stratification. It's an excellent method for farmers looking to get a head start on the growing season.",

Collaborators include researchers from Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S.\n\n- Researchers have developed a digital method (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn, which they have tested against human raters with promising results. They are now refining the training methods to improve the model's accuracy.\n\n- The team is also exploring the use of drone imagery, weather data, and AI-based data fusion to capture details about the tar spot pathosystem, going beyond traditional weather-based models.\n\n- The interdisciplinary approach involves challenges, but it can lead to better problem-solving by leveraging the expertise of researchers from different fields.\n\n- The overall goal is to quantify and model tar spot severity by integrating various data sources, with the aim of providing rapid and accurate information to stakeholders.",
