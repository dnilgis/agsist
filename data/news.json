      "summary": "Tracey Coulter, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources' first-ever agroforester, received the Lifetime Achievement award at the event. \n\nAgroforestry is an ancient practice that provides benefits like shade for livestock, which can increase milk production and weight gain. Farmer Eli Mack has incorporated more trees on his 50-head beef cattle operation, Mack Farms, in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. Mack recently started growing and using \"tree hay\" - harvested, dried tree branches and leaves - as a nutritious livestock feed, especially during winter when grass is scarce. Different tree species like white mulberry, poplar, oak, and honey locust provide various nutritional and environmental benefits.\n\nWhile agroforestry was long overlooked, it is becoming more accepted today. Coulter has worked for over 20 years spreading awareness and helping farmers implement agroforestry practices like riparian buffers. Her work has protected water, built soil, and supported biodiversity. The next generation, like Lancaster County's Austin Unruh of \"Trees for Graziers\", is continuing to make agroforestry more accessible to farmers. Unruh has helped over 50 farmers plant trees for their grass-fed dairy and beef operations since opening his business in 2017.",

Iowa currently has the 2nd highest cancer incidence rate in the U.S., which is rising while the national rate is falling. Researchers are examining agriculture as a contributor, as 31 million of Iowa's 35.7 million acres are intensively farmed.\n\nThe report also touts potential benefits of E15 like sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture/storage, but these are described as \"potential\" and face significant obstacles like lack of public support for CO2 pipelines and over $10 billion in estimated federal subsidies. \n\nThe article argues the simplest solution is for farmers to plant something other than corn, as there is no requirement to grow one crop. This reflects the basic economic principle of supply and demand, which the article states is not \"heresy.\"",

The strong export demand has reduced soybean supplies, with soybean stocks projected to fall to 275 million bushels by the end of the 2022/23 marketing year, the lowest in 8 years.\n\nConcerns over soybean production in Brazil and Argentina, the world's second and third largest producers, have also supported soybean prices. Brazil's crop is estimated at 152 million metric tons, down 4% from the previous year, due to drought. Argentina's crop is expected to be 49 million metric tons, down 7% from last year, also due to dry conditions.\n\nThe rally in soybean prices provides a boost for U.S. farmers, who are facing high costs for fertilizer, fuel and other inputs.

FMD will receive $35 million, while MAP will get $177 million.\n\nThe funding aims to maintain and grow markets for U.S. agricultural products abroad. Key target markets include China, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and the European Union. Top commodities include meat, dairy, grains, oilseeds, produce, and specialty crops.\n\nThese programs help U.S. farmers, ranchers, and food processors promote their products worldwide through advertising, market research, technical assistance, and other activities. Over the past 5 years, FMD and MAP have helped increase agricultural exports by an estimated $309 billion.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack stated the investments will \"open new doors\" for American ag exports, supporting farm income and rural economic growth. Industry groups applauded the funding, calling it critical to maintaining a competitive edge in global markets.",

      "summary": "The poultry industry is facing significant challenges in disease management, with the recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) causing major disruptions. In 2022, over 58 million birds were affected by HPAI across 47 states, resulting in a 7% drop in U.S. egg production and a 4% decline in broiler production compared to 2021.\n\nTo address these issues, the industry is focusing on several key strategies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has allocated $51 million in funding to support HPAI response and preparedness efforts, including the development of a national HPAI vaccine bank. Additionally, the USDA is working with state partners to implement biosecurity measures and streamline response protocols.\n\nPoultry producers are also enhancing their own disease management practices. According to the National Chicken Council, 95% of broiler farms have implemented enhanced biosecurity measures, such as restricting visitor access and increasing disinfection procedures. Furthermore, the industry is exploring the use of HPAI vaccines to protect flocks, though their effectiveness and commercial availability are still being evaluated.\n\nDr. Suzanne Dougherty, a poultry veterinarian, emphasizes the importance of early detection and swift response in managing disease outbreaks. She notes that the industry has made significant strides in improving surveillance and communication, but ongoing challenges remain, particularly in addressing the economic impact on producers.\n\nAs the poultry industry navigates these complex issues, continued collaboration between regulators, researchers, and producers will be crucial in developing effective strategies to safeguard the health and productivity of the nation's poultry flocks.",

The tractor was built at the company's facility in Racine, Wisconsin and features a stars-and-stripes paint scheme designed by a local artist. \n\nThe design incorporates strategic contour lines that not only depict the land around Racine, but also relate to the data and precision farming tools used by farmers. Other subtle design elements, like the red rims on the wheels, connect the Heartland Magnum to Case IH's autonomous tractor concept from a decade ago.\n\nThis special-edition tractor will be on display at trade shows and events around the country throughout 2026, the year of America's 250th birthday. Matt Booms, a tractor product specialist with Case IH, stated that the Heartland Magnum is a \"tribute to Americana, to the hardworking men and women who use these machines, as well as to the hardworking men and women that build these machines and engineer them.\"",

This follows years of litigation with Dairy UK, the trade association for the British dairy industry, after Oatly filed their trademark application in 2019 and received registration in 2021.\n\nThe court affirmed that Oatly's trademark \"Post Milk Generation\" cannot remain valid for their oat-based products, as the term \"milk\" is legally reserved for dairy products. However, the trademark can still be used for their Class 25 products (T-shirts).\n\nThe ruling signals a strict approach to \"category borrowing\" - using regulated food terms to market alternatives that don't legally qualify. Legal experts advised plant-based producers to use clear descriptive alternatives like \"oat drink\" or \"plant-based drink\" instead.\n\nDairy UK welcomed the decision as a win for consumer protection, while Oatly criticized it as anti-competitive and benefiting \"Big Dairy\". Oatly indicated they will explore alternative ways to keep their \"Post Milk Generation\" message, such as merchandise.\n\nThe verdict follows established EU case law supporting restrictions on using dairy terms for plant-based products. It underscores the need for plant-based brands to carefully plan their marketing strategy around legally defined product names.",

Another 146 employees will return in early March to the Waterloo Tractor Operations to support 8R tractor production.\n\nThis comes after widespread layoffs in 2025, when John Deere let go of nearly 600 workers across four facilities in Iowa - Des Moines Works, Waterloo Works, Ottumwa Works, and Davenport Works.\n\nThe recalls signal improved short-term production outlooks and are a welcome boost for Iowa communities heavily tied to agricultural and construction manufacturing. Ensuring experienced workers are in place is critical as orders rebound, according to Mark Dickson, vice president of Deere's construction and forestry manufacturing operations.\n\nThe moves suggest that at least in parts of Deere's portfolio, demand is strong enough to put laid-off employees back on the factory floor - a development that will be closely watched in Iowa's ag manufacturing sector.",

      "summary": "The CropLife 100 report reveals that the largest ag retail facilities in the U.S. have expanded their networks significantly in recent years. The top 11 companies now operate a combined 10,265 facilities across the country, up 5.9% from 2021. Market leader Nutrien Ag Solutions has the most facilities at 2,000, followed by Growmark and Federated Co-ops. Many companies are focusing on improving logistics, agronomy support, and service capacity through these expansions. Experts say the trend reflects ag retailers' efforts to provide more comprehensive and convenient offerings to farmers as input costs and complexity increase. Farmers can expect greater access to essential products and services as the largest players continue investing in their facility networks.",

However, ARA is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy, including building relationships with lawmakers, engaging in grassroots advocacy, and leveraging its political action committee to support pro-agriculture candidates.\n\nLooking ahead, Coppock emphasized the importance of continued vigilance and engagement in the political process. Ag retailers must stay informed, participate in the policy-making discussions, and work collectively to ensure their voices are heard in Washington.\n\nUltimately, the success of the ag retail industry depends on its ability to navigate the complex political landscape and advocate for policies that foster a thriving and sustainable agricultural sector.",

This option allowed farmers to insure against years when weather prevents them from planting a crop.\n\nWithout this option in 2026, North Dakota farmers like Justin Quandt, who farms near Oakes, will have less protection against wet spring conditions that can leave some of their fields unplantable. Quandt's family normally invests in the additional prevented planting coverage, which requires insuring all acres in a county.\n\nThe North Dakota Farmers Union president Matt Perdue said the agency's decision is disappointing, as the recent farm bill had expanded federal crop insurance in other ways. However, an NDSU study concluded that the improvements will not outweigh the loss of the extra prevented planting coverage for North Dakota.\n\nSenators, including John Hoeven of North Dakota, have asked the USDA to undo the prevented planting changes for 2027 and beyond \"to help provide a layer of certainty when disasters beyond their control render them unable to plant a crop.\" \n\nFarmers face a March 15 deadline to make 2026 crop insurance purchases. Insurance agent Bethany Rentz hopes the USDA will bring back the extra prevented planting coverage based on pushback from other affected states.",

Inflation-adjusted operating loan sizes were about 30% larger than the previous year, reflecting elevated input costs and expanded financing needs. \n\nIncreased feeder cattle lending also contributed to stronger loan demand. Loan terms adjusted alongside the rising balances, with average maturities for operating loans increasing by about 3 months from 2024 and reaching record highs. Machinery and equipment loan maturities also lengthened.\n\nInterest rates on non-real-estate loans declined for the 6th straight quarter, with larger loans seeing greater reductions. However, over 80% of operating loans carried variable rates as borrowers positioned for potential further declines.\n\nThe overall takeaway is that bigger operating loans are helping farms manage costs, but also signaling a growing reliance on borrowed capital.",

Restoring pollinator habitat on agricultural landscapes is important, and can be done cost-effectively. Planting a diverse mix of flowering plants, even in small areas, can support a variety of bee species.\n\n4. Research shows that the amount of surrounding agricultural land or size of the habitat area does not significantly impact bee diversity and abundance, as long as there are sufficient floral resources.\n\n5. Integrating pollinator habitat into croplands can have benefits for natural pest control, and can even improve yields for self-pollinating crops like soybeans.\n\n6. Funding sources and conservation programs may be available to assist farmers in establishing and maintaining pollinator habitat.\n\n7.

Prairie Strips: Planting 10-25% of farmland in prairie strips can attract beneficial predators, improve soil nutrients, and boost yields by supporting pollinators and pest-controlling insects.\n\n2. Low Tilling: Reducing tillage and using cover crops can improve soil structure and support greater biodiversity above and below ground.\n\n3. Regenerative Grazing: Rotating livestock and using native plants, fire, and mowing can maintain healthy pastures and provide habitat for local species, especially in areas with prairie or forest ecosystems. \n\n4. Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Attracting beneficial insects through diverse plantings and cultural practices can reduce reliance on harmful pesticides.\n\n5. Conservation Easements: Partnering with land trusts to establish conservation easements can protect natural resources and provide tax benefits for farmers with large landholdings.\n\nImplementing these strategies, even partially, can have significant positive impacts on biodiversity and farm productivity by working with natural systems rather than against them. Experts emphasize that farming is as much for humans as it is a constant reminder of the laws of the natural world, and the more farmers can see their land as part of a larger ecosystem, the more sustainable their agriculture can become.",
