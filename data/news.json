Beef Quality Assurance (BQA) is a program developed by cattlemen in cooperation with the USDA, focused on ensuring beef products are raised with animal welfare, food safety, and responsible management in mind.\n\n2. In Nebraska, veterinarians like Dr. Sierra Rush from Rice Veterinarian Services are directly involved in BQA training, helping producers apply research-based practices to their operations.\n\n3. Dr. Rush sees her role as a \"middleman\" between the producers and the BQA program, using her veterinary knowledge and hands-on experience to explain the importance of BQA practices and how they can be implemented.\n\n4. BQA training covers key areas such as animal behavior and handling, herd health management, biosecurity, record-keeping, emergency action planning, and transportation.\n\n5. By using research to support BQA practices, Dr. Rush helps producers understand that the program is not about meeting minimum requirements but about improving consistency and accountability across the beef supply chain.\n\n6. After BQA trainings, Dr. Rush often sees producers making management changes that reflect BQA principles, ranging from simple tasks like vaccine mixing to more complex efforts like developing biosecurity plans.\n\n7. The BQA program helps boost public confidence by assuring consumers that producers are doing everything they can to ensure animal welfare is a top priority.",

This ability to better metabolize casein gives S. aureus a competitive advantage in the nutrient-rich environment of the cow's udder, enabling the bacteria to thrive and cause persistent mastitis infections.\n\nThe findings highlight the importance of continued monitoring and research to understand how mastitis-causing pathogens are adapting over time.

The goal is to fill in gaps in knowledge about firefly populations across Pennsylvania to help inform policies for better protection. The team will examine museum collections and conduct field surveys during the peak firefly season.\n\nThe inventory will focus on areas like the Allegheny National Forest, which is known for high firefly populations. Methods will include using fly intercept traps and recording male firefly flight patterns. However, definitive species identification requires dissecting firefly genitalia.\n\nThe inventory is prompted by concerns about potential firefly declines, as they are becoming harder to find outside of protected natural areas. Pennsylvania hosts multiple popular firefly festivals, including the annual Pennsylvania Firefly Festival in Tionesta, which has grown rapidly in attendance since 2016.\n\nOrganizers Peggy and Ken Butler now use a lottery system to limit the festival to 75 attendees for two nighttime tours. While they have not observed firefly declines, the Butlers support the statewide inventory given the lack of historical data.

      "summary": "The defendants - Jed Wood, Joshua Link, Tia Link, Taylor Bang, and Royana Thomas - were associated with a business called Agridime LLC in Fort Worth, Texas. \n\nFrom January 2021 through December 2023, the defendants allegedly misled over 2,200 victims across the U.S. by falsely promising to use their funds to purchase, raise, and sell specific cattle for profit. Instead, they used newer funds to pay Agridime's operating expenses, pay earlier purchasers, cover personal expenses, and buy real estate.\n\nThe charges include 3-10 counts of wire fraud, 1 count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and 1-2 counts of money laundering per defendant. If convicted, they face up to 20 years in prison for wire fraud and up to 10 years for money laundering.\n\nJoshua Link remains a fugitive, and the FBI is asking the public for information on his location. Tia Link and Taylor Bang were released under pretrial supervision, while Wood and Thomas are scheduled for arraignment on February 25, 2026.\n\nThe FBI's Fort Worth Resident Agency conducted the investigation with assistance from the USDA Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark McDonald is prosecuting the case.",

This label is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and means that no additional sugars were added during processing or packaging. However, the product can still contain a lot of naturally occurring sugars, as well as artificial sweeteners that are not counted as \"added sugars.\" \n\nThe \"no sugar added\" label is different from \"sugar free\" (less than 0.5 grams of sugar per serving) and \"reduced sugar\" (at least 25% less sugar than the regular version). Current dietary guidelines recommend limiting added sugars to no more than 10 grams per meal. \n\nTo make healthy choices, it's important to look at the full nutrition label, including the breakdown of total vs. added sugars, rather than relying solely on the \"no sugar added\" claim. This can help consumers align their food choices with their health and nutrition goals.",

Kale - Feeds the soil, people, livestock, and can be a specialty market crop. Needs slightly warmer soil of at least 45°F. Resistant varieties recommended in disease-prone areas.\n\n3. Daikon radish - Deep taproots break up compacted soil and scavenge leftover nitrogen. Requires soil temperature of at least 65°F.\n\n4. Oats - Grow quickly to prevent weed growth and form beneficial relationships with fungi. Can be sown with peas for nitrogen fixing. Tolerate temperatures down to 20°F.\n\n5. Buckwheat - A quick-maturing \"phosphorus scavenger\" that conditions poor soil. Can be used as a mulch after flowering.\n\nFarmers should consider their local climate and use low tunnels if needed to provide extra warmth and protection for the cover crops during cold weather.

This will allow the current site next to Falls Park to be redeveloped.\n\nSmithfield, the city's 4th largest employer with over 3,100 workers, plans to open the new modern plant in Foundation Park near Interstates 90 and 29. Smithfield CEO Shane Smith called it a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\" for Sioux Falls, employees, and agriculture.\n\nThe current Smithfield plant (formerly John Morrell & Co.) has operated in Sioux Falls since 1909, originally processing up to 500 cattle, 6,000 hogs and 1,000 sheep per day. The company was founded in England in 1827 and expanded to the U.S. in 1864. \n\nThere has been significant labor strife at the plant over the years, including a sit-down strike in 1935 that led to the National Guard being mobilized. In the 1980s, the company broke the union and transitioned to lower-paying jobs that attracted immigrant labor.\n\nSmithfield acquired the plant in 1995 when it purchased John Morrell & Co. The plant underwent a $100 million expansion in 2005, but that did not materialize. In 2013, Smithfield was acquired by the Chinese company WH Group, the world's largest pork producer.",

Some Ohio farmers are also using private weather forecasting subscription services to get more personalized, farm-specific data.\n\nDuane Stateler, a crop and hog farmer in northwestern Ohio, has used a private weather forecasting service for 14 years. His service, BAMwx.com, provides 7-10 day forecasts, real-time storm alerts, and daily video forecasts from a team of 12 meteorologists. Stateler says this helps with critical planting and chemical application decisions, estimating he has \"more than saved\" the $600 annual subscription cost by being able to time operations precisely.\n\nThe article notes that other agricultural forecasting tools are also emerging, such as Ranchbot for pasture management, and companies like Tempest and DTN using public data and machine learning to deliver hyper-local forecasts. \n\nOhio State Extension plans to install mesonet weather stations in all 88 counties by 2025, providing public data to improve disease/pest scouting alerts, crop modeling, and temperature monitoring for farmers.\n\nAaron Wilson, an OSU Extension climate specialist, says short-term forecasting is most reliable 3-5 days out, so denser data networks are key to increasing accuracy for agricultural needs like planting windows and drought monitoring.",

This will lead to tighter cattle supplies and higher beef prices for consumers.\n\n- Cattle prices are expected to average $160-$170 per cwt in 2026, up from $155 per cwt in 2025. Calf prices are forecast to average $220-$240 per cwt.\n\n- Drought conditions have persisted across the Southern Plains, impacting pasture and feed availability. This has contributed to the herd liquidation.\n\n- Randy Blach advised cattle producers to carefully manage their herds and expenses given the market volatility. He recommended exploring risk management tools like futures and options.\n\n- The National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) is working to promote beef demand both domestically and internationally to offset the tighter supply.\n\n- Blach expects the beef industry to remain profitable overall in 2026, though profitability may be squeezed for cow-calf producers dealing with higher feed costs.",

Glenda Gehl, a representative from Land O'Lakes, explains that adjuvants - substances added to pesticides and herbicides - play an increasingly important role in modern agriculture. \n\nAdjuvants can improve spray coverage, droplet size, and penetration, leading to more effective and efficient pesticide and herbicide applications. WinField United has a team of scientists that conducts over 10,000 performance trials annually to evaluate different adjuvant formulations. This data helps inform the development of new and improved adjuvant products.\n\nOne new adjuvant, Unite, was recently introduced by WinField United. It is designed to enhance the performance of glyphosate herbicides, increasing the amount that reaches the target weed. Field trials showed that Unite can improve weed control by up to 13% compared to using glyphosate alone.\n\nGehl emphasizes that selecting the right adjuvant is crucial for farmers to get the most out of their pesticide and herbicide applications. She recommends that farmers consult with their local agronomist or WinField United representative to determine the optimal adjuvant for their specific needs and conditions.",

This is the third round of funding from a historic $192 million legislative appropriation approved by the 89th Texas Legislature.\n\nThe RVFDAP, established by Texas House Bill 2604 in 2001, provides grants to rural volunteer fire departments for essential firefighting equipment and training. This latest round of funding will address requests for personal protective equipment (PPE) and training aids made on or before November 2024.\n\nThe first two rounds of funding in October and December 2025 awarded a total of $181.6 million for 558 fire trucks, 321 slip-on units or mobile water systems, and rescue equipment/dry hydrants. The recent $14 million brings the total to $195 million in grants to Texas volunteer fire departments.\n\nWhile the latest round largely satisfies outstanding requests, the RVFDAP also secured approximately $88 million in base funding for fiscal years 2026-27 to address ongoing equipment needs at the local level. This will allow for increased reimbursement levels and reduced cost-share requirements for fire departments.\n\nTexas fire departments can access resources through FireConnect, a centralized database managed by the Texas A&M Forest Service. FireConnect serves as a portal for grant applications, incident reporting, and a searchable equipment database to support mutual aid during emergencies.\n\nJason Keiningham, capacity building department head for the Texas A&M Forest Service, stated that this funding has allowed them to \"expedite the awards schedule to cover the list of unfunded requests\" and provide support to fire departments that may have been on waiting lists for years.",

Frost seeding can be a cost-effective way to rejuvenate a declining stand or introduce new legumes, but success depends on timing, soil conditions, and the condition of the existing stand.\n5.

Sandy soils are less ideal as they don't expand/contract as much during freeze-thaw.\n\n- Adequate spring moisture is vital for establishing a healthy stand after frost seeding. The success of frost seeded stands depends significantly on spring moisture levels.\n\n- The author is Dr. Shelby Gruss, an assistant professor and forage extension specialist who joined Iowa State University in November 2023.

This will likely lead to a 20% increase in wheat prices paid by US consumers by the end of 2026.\n\nThe USDA is offering $500 million in emergency aid to wheat farmers to help offset these losses. Applications for the aid program are due by June 30, 2026.\n\nExperts predict these wheat supply and price challenges will continue for the next 12-18 months, until production can recover.

Leafy types mature quickly, while heading types need more tending.\n5. Lettuce, which can handle some late frost and is easy to start directly sown or in trays.\n6. Carrots and parsnips, which need to be direct sown due to their sensitive taproots.\n7. Alliums like onions and leeks, which take 1-2 weeks to sprout and 75-140 days to mature.\n\nThe article notes that February is the right time to start these crops, as they either take a long time to mature, are slow to germinate, or prefer the cool conditions of early spring. Proper growing setups like greenhouses and cold frames can protect these plants until the weather warms.",

Yields were similar between CT/ST (78.4 bu/ac) and NT (77.6 bu/ac), with NT+CR being slightly lower at 76.2 bu/ac.\n- While yields were comparable, the no-till systems had higher partial net returns due to lower operational costs.\n- The NT+CR system had the lowest partial net return due to the higher cost of cover crop management, estimated at $55/ac.\n\nThe project will continue in 2026 to track medium-term responses as the soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics change under the conservation systems.

Many of these need a period of cold stratification, which the winter sowing method provides.\n\nSpecific varieties mentioned include 'Carex' cabbage for shorter maturation, 'Avon' spinach for mildew resistance, and different groups of snapdragons suited to varying light and heat conditions.\n\nThe article notes that winter sowing offers the benefits of direct sowing with less risk, and provides a natural way to break dormancy for plants that require cold stratification. It's an excellent method for farmers looking to get a head start on the growing season.",

It has also affected crops in 15 other countries.\n\n- The research team, led by C.D. Cruz, associate professor of botany and plant pathology at Purdue, is using a mix of statistical, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, artificial intelligence, and computer vision methods to understand the dynamics of tar spot.\n\n- The research is funded by two USDA grants totaling nearly $1.1 million. Collaborators include researchers from Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S.\n\n- Researchers have developed a digital method (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn, which they have tested against human raters with promising results. They are now refining the training methods to improve the model's accuracy.\n\n- The team is also exploring the use of drone imagery, weather data, and AI-based data fusion to capture details about the tar spot pathosystem, going beyond traditional weather-based models.\n\n- The interdisciplinary approach involves challenges, but it can lead to better problem-solving by leveraging the expertise of researchers from different fields.\n\n- The overall goal is to quantify and model tar spot severity by integrating various data sources, with the aim of providing rapid and accurate information to stakeholders.",
