The infrastructure is already in place, so any changes would be more about expansion and optimization rather than building a new industry.\n\n3. Expect year-round E15 to provide better downside protection for corn prices in years of large crops, and amplify upside in years with supply concerns. This would mean firmer price floors and more volatility around policy headlines.\n\n4. Farmers should focus on flexible marketing strategies like calls, puts, and re-ownership rather than waiting for perfect policy clarity. Disciplined marketing will be key in this headline-driven market.\n\n5. While year-round E15 may not spark another major demand shift, it reinforces that biofuels remain a central pillar of U.S. corn demand that can expand rather than just shuffle existing use.\n\n6.

It brings together expertise across Texas A&M to advance the abilities of agriculture and forestry systems to meet modern demands for safe, affordable food and fiber production on thriving working lands.\n\nThe center focuses on converging research, teaching, and extension efforts, with ongoing research on the sustainability of practices like carbon capture in Texas soils and crops. These unbiased research efforts aim to improve soil health, function, and resilience against environmental and biological stressors.\n\n\"We are immensely grateful for the generous support of the Hood Family, which paved the way for this important work,\" said G. Cliff Lamb, Ph.D., director of AgriLife Research. \"Texas A&M AgriLife is committed to leading new discoveries, technologies, and emerging practices that benefit the state, the U.S., and the world.\"\n\n\"The generous support from the Hood family is critical to our mission,\" said Nithya Rajan, Ph.D., director of the center and an agronomy and agroecology professor. \"We are turning science into producer-ready solutions that strengthen soil health, reduce input costs, and keep working lands productive for generations.\"",

The system integrates with Vytelle's SENSE feed intake nodes, allowing farmers to measure enteric emissions alongside feed efficiency.\n\nThe system uses a reticulorumen bolus to continuously monitor methane emissions from individual animals. It provides real-time data on methane production, feed intake, and feed efficiency. This enables farmers to identify and select low-methane emitting animals to improve the environmental sustainability of their herd.\n\nAccording to Vytelle, the system costs $350 per animal, which is significantly lower than existing methane monitoring technologies. It is currently available in the United States, with plans for international expansion.\n\nVytelle claims the system can help cattle producers reduce their carbon footprint and prepare for potential future regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. The company is partnering with researchers to further develop the technology and collect more data on the relationship between feed efficiency, methane production, and animal performance.\n\nThe launch of this system comes as the agricultural industry faces growing pressure to address its environmental impact, particularly from livestock production. Vytelle's new technology provides a cost-effective solution for farmers to measure and manage their herd's methane emissions.",

The group believes that renewing the USMCA is crucial for the continued growth and stability of the U.S. food and agricultural sectors.\n\nThe USMCA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has been in effect since July 2020. It has provided significant benefits to U.S. farmers and ranchers, including increased market access and improved trading relationships with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe coalition is working to ensure that the USMCA remains in place and continues to support the U.S. agricultural industry. They are advocating for the U.S. government to prioritize the renewal of the agreement before it expires in 2026.\n\nFarmers and ranchers are encouraged to engage with their elected representatives to express their support for the USMCA renewal and to highlight the importance of maintaining a strong agricultural trade relationship with Canada and Mexico.",

The bill is set for a public hearing on February 17, 2026.\n\nSupporters argue mandatory inspection remains crucial to verify cattle ownership, especially with high cattle values. However, the bill's sponsor, Sen. Ben Hansen, says the current system is inefficient and burdensome for producers. The Nebraska Farm Bureau opposes eliminating the mandatory brand inspection program.\n\nMeanwhile, the Brand Committee is changing how it charges mileage for inspections. Effective January 19, 2026, the $20 per-inspection surcharge will be discontinued, and the committee will instead charge the actual mileage incurred by inspectors. This change comes after a complaint filed with the Nebraska Attorney General's Office questioning the committee's mileage fee authority.\n\nOther legislative proposals aim to preserve the Brand Committee while adjusting fee structures, such as raising inspection fee caps and potentially re-authorizing a mileage surcharge. The debate reflects an ongoing discussion about the future of Nebraska's brand inspection system.",

Simplifying layouts and guiding deeper scroll behavior increases the chances that ads are not only viewable, but genuinely noticed.\n\nAttention time is a clearer indicator of real impact than click-through rate, as it measures whether users stayed with the content, scrolled with purpose, and consumed multiple articles. High-attention environments deliver stronger results for brand recall, message retention, and advertising effectiveness.\n\nThe article concludes that the improvements on AgWeb translate into more value for brands, providing a template for increasing engagement and attention. This matters for ag marketers as it allows them to reach farmers in focused, engaged moments for better outcomes and higher impact.",

      "summary": "S. Department of the Treasury and IRS have released proposed regulations for the clean fuel production tax credit under the One, Big, Beautiful Bill (OBBB). The credit applies to qualifying clean transportation fuels produced in the U.S. after December 31, 2024 and sold by December 31, 2029. \n\nKey details:\n- The credit is extended through December 31, 2029\n- Eligible feedstocks are limited to those grown/produced in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada\n- Restrictions are added related to prohibited foreign entities\n- The special rate for sustainable aviation fuel is eliminated \n- Negative emissions rates are prohibited, except for fuels derived from animal manure\n- Emissions calculations will use a USDA model rather than the DOE's GREET model\n\nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall welcomed the proposed guidance as a step forward, but said more work is needed from USDA and DOE to finalize implementation details. Duvall noted that expanding domestic biofuel production could provide much-needed support to the farm economy.\n\nThe public comment period is now open, and stakeholders have until the scheduled public hearing to submit feedback on the proposed 45Z credit regulations.",

ECO provides area-based insurance coverage from 86% up to 95%, with choices of 90% or 95% coverage.\n\n4. The federal government has increased premium subsidies for both SCO and ECO to 80% in 2026, up from 65% in 2025 and 44% in 2024.\n\n5. This increase in premium subsidies is expected to result in more acres being insured under ECO coverage, up from 15.6 million acres in 2024 to 61.8 million acres in 2025.\n\n6. Utilizing SCO and ECO coverage, together with a Revenue Protection policy, can provide an excellent risk management package for farmers.\n\n7. The deadline to enroll in crop insurance for corn and soybeans in 2026 is March 16.\n\n8. Farmers should contact their crop insurance agent for details, premium quotes, and examples on SCO and ECO coverage options.",

Warm-season perennials may not work well for a July reseeding, but summer annuals like sudangrass, sorghum-sudangrass, pearl millet, and teff grass can be good options.\n- For August/September reseedings, oats, triticale, and annual ryegrass are recommended to graze or harvest in the spring.\n- Grasses and legumes each provide different benefits - grasses reduce erosion while legumes add nitrogen and can increase carrying capacity, but must be balanced to avoid issues like grass tetany or bloat.\n- Key preparation steps include soil testing/amendments, weed control, using high-quality seed, inoculating legumes, suppressing existing vegetation, calibrating equipment, and planting the best crop for the timing.\n- Farmers should leverage resources and have conversations to develop a thorough plan for dealing with unscheduled pipeline easement work.",

Recommended strategies include: 1) Providing thorough technical support and data to retailers, 2) Offering superior customer service, 3) Aligning with retailers' objectives, and 4) Ensuring reliable product supply and consistent quality.\n\nRetailers want biological companies to clearly communicate product benefits, performance data, and return on investment for farmers. Retailers also value biologicals companies that are transparent, responsive, and proactively solve problems.\n\nBuilding strong relationships is crucial, as retailers control 85-90% of the biologicals market access point for farmers. Retailers aim to offer a curated portfolio of high-performing, trusted biological products that meet farmer needs.\n\nThe article cites ARA President and CEO Daren Coppock, who emphasizes the importance of building retailer confidence through technical expertise, customer service, and reliable supply. Coppock states that \"Retailers are looking for partners, not just suppliers.\"",

However, Texas producers held back 50,000 more heifers, an 8% increase in replacements that could indicate the early stages of a gradual herd rebuild.\n\nNationally, beef cow numbers dropped just over 1%, a sharper decline than expected. Experts anticipate a slower cattle herd rebuild and tighter cattle supplies will continue to impact the industry from cow-calf operations to feedlots, packers, and grocery stores. \n\nHigh calf prices and concerns over a rapid herd rebuild and subsequent price drops are causing some ranchers to prioritize short-term returns by selling bred heifers rather than holding them back for herd growth. Bred heifer values have reached $4,000-$5,000.\n\nTexas' long-term cattle capacity has also been impacted by urban expansion, land fragmentation, and conversion of pasture to non-agricultural uses. Emerging drought is another factor that could influence producer decisions.\n\nExperts expect calf prices could climb even higher in 2026-2027 due to the tightened supplies, with 500-600 lb steers currently averaging $450/cwt in Texas compared to $326/cwt last year. Cow-calf producer margins should remain strong, supported by lower feed costs and sustained demand.\n\nHowever, the outlook for Texas will depend heavily on how the drought situation evolves in the state. Recent winter storms brought snow, ice, and freezing temperatures, causing challenges for livestock producers with some calf losses reported. Wheat and oat crops were also impacted.",

This is an improvement over the extremely mild winter of 2024, but not as favorable as the strong polar vortex in 2019 which caused up to 90% aphid mortality.\n\nFor alfalfa weevil, the article states that with soil temperatures only reaching a minimum of 15.4°F at one location, not much mortality is expected this year. Northern areas with less snow cover may see slight reductions in alfalfa weevil pressure.\n\nCorn rootworm forecasting is more complex, as their eggs overwinter in the soil. At the coldest 4 and 8-inch soil temperatures recorded (-19.4°F and -23.0°F), not much acute mortality is expected. Rootworm mortality depends on both temperature and duration of exposure.\n\nEmerald ash borer, while not a field crop pest, was also discussed. The article predicts 25% or more mortality in the northern half of the state after accounting for the insulation provided by ash tree bark.\n\nThe article recommends that farmers be proactive about scouting for soybean aphids this year, and consider aphid-resistant soybean varieties if available.

These retailers often lack the scale or capital to buy directly from factories.\n\n- Wholesalers break large production runs into smaller, manageable assortments and replenishment programs, keeping these outlets viable. They also democratize access to compliance, traceability, and quality standards.\n\n- Without wholesalers, retail assortments would narrow, buying would become more conservative, and out-of-stocks would increase. This would reduce cotton's retail footprint and concentrate demand among fewer players, increasing vulnerability across the supply chain.\n\n- The article cites expert Bob Antoshak, who states that this \"long tail\" of retail plays a meaningful role in sustaining cotton consumption.\n\n- The key takeaway for farmers is that wholesale distribution helps sustain the diversity of cotton demand.",
