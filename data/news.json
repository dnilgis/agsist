However, the Homeland Security Department is only funded for two weeks under a continuing resolution. The vote was 71-29.\n\nSince the Homeland Security section of the bill is different from the version passed by the House earlier, the House will have to consider the measure again. This will result in a short-term partial government shutdown until the House takes action.\n\nThe Agriculture Department, Food and Drug Administration, and some other agencies will remain open as they were funded through September 30 under separate legislation. The bill covers the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education, and smaller agencies.",

The NWS fly poses a serious threat to Texas' livestock industry and wildlife. Though not yet present in Texas or the U.S., its northward spread from Mexico towards the southern border is a major concern.\n\n3. The disaster declaration aims to \"better equip the New World Screwworm Response Team\" by allowing them to fully utilize state government resources for prevention and response.\n\n4. Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller welcomed the declaration, stating it will give the task force greater authority, resources and speed to confront the growing threat.\n\n5. Miller urged Texas producers, especially those in border regions, to remain alert and take proactive steps like closely inspecting animals, watching for unusual behavior, and promptly treating injuries.\n\n6. Texas has been working closely with the USDA on NWS prevention and detection. In June 2025, Governor Abbott directed state agencies to enhance surveillance and response planning.\n\n7. The goal is to fully eradicate the NWS pest if it reaches Texas, protecting the state's livestock industry and wildlife.",

The rule was initially set to begin on February 1, 2026, but ongoing court action and Congressional direction have made moving forward impractical.\n\nThe final rule, first published in May 2024, was designed to strengthen the enforcement of the Horse Protection Act, which aims to stop the practice of soring - intentionally causing pain to horses to force an exaggerated, high-stepping gait. The key changes included a shift from an industry-led inspection system to USDA-authorized Horse Protection Inspectors.\n\nThe delay is due to three main factors:\n1. A federal district court in the Northern District of Texas vacated several key provisions of the 2024 rule in January 2025, including restrictions related to pads, action devices, and changes to the \"scar rule.\"\n2. Another lawsuit challenged existing HPA regulations and policies, including limits on noncompliant horses competing in later classes and scar rule standards, leading to a preliminary injunction in August 2025.\n3. A House Committee Report tied to the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations process directed APHIS to withdraw the 2024 final rule, further complicating the regulatory path forward.\n\nAPHIS leadership stated that implementing only the surviving pieces while major provisions remain under litigation would be unworkable for the industry and inspectors, leading to a \"patchwork\" of rules. As a result, horse show managers won't have to begin new recordkeeping and reporting requirements in February 2026, as originally planned.\n\nDeputy Administrator Bernadette Juarez said, \"Moving forward with a partial implementation while key provisions are under litigation would result in an unworkable patchwork of rules. This delay ensures that APHIS has the time to identify the most appropriate next steps to effectively end the practice of soring while providing clarity and regulatory certainty to exhibitors, managers, and owners.\"",

The SEC found that former ADM executives, including Chief Financial Officer Vikram Luthar, artificially inflated the value of the Nutrition business to make it appear more profitable than it was. This involved shifting funds from other ADM business units into Nutrition. \n\nThe SEC alleged that Luthar played a \"central role\" in the fraud, which began in 2019 before he became Nutrition's CFO. He continued the practice of improperly boosting Nutrition's performance, including through a $20 million \"rebate\" transaction in 2021. Two other ADM executives, Vincent Macciocchi and Ray Young, were also implicated.\n\nWhile ADM did not admit wrongdoing, it cooperated with the SEC investigation. The U.S. Department of Justice had been pursuing a criminal probe of the company since 2024 but ultimately dropped the case. However, an ADM investor has filed an ongoing lawsuit over the fraudulent accounting.\n\nThe Nutrition business had become a key focus for ADM, with executives touting it as the \"engine for future growth\" and tying executive bonuses to its performance. This created incentives for other ADM business units to help Nutrition meet its goals, even at their own expense.\n\nIn the wake of the scandal, ADM has taken steps to enhance its internal controls and financial reporting practices to rebuild trust with stakeholders. The company maintains it will continue operating with \"transparency and integrity.\"",

      "summary": "Americans will eat 1.48 billion chicken wings for Super Bowl LX, according to the National Chicken Council. This figure represents an increase of about 10 million more wings than last year's game. \n\nIn the latest four weeks (playoff window), chicken wing units surged nationally 19.8% year-over-year, and dollars were up 11.4% versus the prior period. In the Seattle retail market, wing sales were up 8.6% in dollars, 26.3% in units, and 22.2% in volume. In the Boston market, wing sales were up 4.4% in dollars, 17.1% in units, and 10.9% in volume.\n\nRetail prices for fresh wings are down 2.8% year-over-year, with a four-week moving average of $3.47 per pound, thanks to U.S. broiler producers boosting domestic production by 2.2% in 2025. However, cold storage inventories reported to end November were at their lowest November total in more than 10 years (outside of 2020 COVID), meaning restaurants, bars, and supermarkets started stocking up well in advance of the Big Game.\n\nThe Super Bowl will take place on February 8, 2026, with the Patriots and Seahawks battling for the Lombardi Trophy. The National Chicken Council spokesperson Tom Super said, \"Football is for food, especially when it comes to the Super Bowl, where wings rule the roost. For football fans looking to add protein to their spreads at an affordable price, wings are king of Super Bowl menus.\"",

Leasing has a lower initial investment, more flexible terms, and easier upgrades, but limits how the equipment can be used. Renting is the most flexible option, allowing farmers to use equipment as needed without a long-term commitment.\n\nThe article advises farmers to carefully calculate the costs and tradeoffs of each option, including interest rates, depreciation, payments, and tax implications. It recommends consulting with a banker, extension office, and accountant to determine the best financing approach for their specific farm operation and needs.\n\nOverall, the article aims to provide farmers with the information they need to make an informed decision on whether to buy, lease, or rent farm equipment in order to remain financially viable in the tight-margin agricultural industry.",

Wrought-iron bread toasters, called \"kick toasters,\" had a revolving basket to toast thick slices of dense, heavily-textured homemade bread. A second style used a suspended basket that could swivel to toast both sides. These toasters were often artfully decorated by blacksmiths. Unlike modern pre-sliced bread, the pioneer bread could not be easily toasted in today's electric toasters. \n\nThe article also covers early coffee roasters, which consisted of a sheet metal cylinder with a long arm and crank to rotate the green coffee beans over a hot coal base. These drum-style roasters became popular in the 1800s as coffee consumption grew in America, replacing tea as the dominant drink.\n\nFor farmers, this historical information provides context on the daily lives and technology used by early settlers in the Ohio region. The specialized tools and methods required for basic foods like bread and coffee highlight how much food production and preparation has evolved. This can help today's farmers appreciate the advances in modern agriculture and kitchen appliances.",

Arizona's Game and Fish Commission voted unanimously in 2021 to ban trail cameras for hunting, citing that the cameras can concentrate animals in limited water resources and give hunters an \"unnatural edge\" over their quarry.\n\n3. This matters for farmers and the agriculture industry because trail cameras are commonly used for wildlife monitoring, research, management, and property protection. The bans could impact these practical applications beyond just hunting.\n\n4. The article notes that while trail cameras can be abused, they also have many legitimate uses. It recommends that hunters use the technology ethically, and states that the Ohio Department of Natural Resources is not currently considering any law changes regarding stationary cameras.",
