Corn for December delivery added 7 cents to $6.72 per bushel. Wheat for December delivery rose 10 cents to $8.08 per bushel.\n\nThe markets were focused on ongoing tight global supplies of grains and oilseeds, which continue to support prices. USDA data showed soybean ending stocks in 2022/23 are projected at just 222 million bushels, down 47% from 2021/22. Corn ending stocks are forecast at 1.182 billion bushels, down 7% year-over-year.\n\nThe lower-than-expected soybean exports could signal weaker demand, but traders seem more concerned about tight inventory levels globally.

This new evidence could have significant implications for dairy consumption and dietary recommendations for farmers and consumers.",

      "summary": "The USDA has announced a plan to address \"agricultural lawfare\", which refers to the use of lawsuits to disrupt agricultural operations. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins unveiled the Farmer and Rancher Freedom Framework on February 12, 2026, aiming to protect farmers and ranchers from frivolous lawsuits.\n\nThe key elements of the plan include:\n- Creating a legal defense fund to help farmers and ranchers fight lawsuits\n- Establishing an \"agricultural ombudsman\" office to mediate disputes before they reach the courts\n- Implementing a \"loser pays\" rule, where plaintiffs who lose lawsuits will be responsible for the defendant's legal fees\n\nThe plan was announced at an event with officials from other federal agencies and a group of farmers and ranchers. It is intended to provide farmers and ranchers with the legal support and protection they need to continue their operations without fear of costly and disruptive lawsuits.\n\nThe goal is to reduce the burden of \"agricultural lawfare\" on the farming community and ensure that farmers and ranchers can focus on food production without unnecessary legal challenges. This initiative is expected to have a positive impact on the agricultural sector by reducing legal costs and providing greater certainty for farmers and ranchers.",

Exhibitors are advised to work with their veterinarians on biosecurity protocols.\n\nThe Board of Animal Health plans to increase surveillance and enforcement of animal movement regulations at fairs and events in 2026. Importing animals without a required CVI can result in fines up to $5,000 per violation, though a $500 penalty is common if no further violations occur in 3 years.\n\nExhibitors are encouraged to reach out to the Board of Animal Health if they have difficulty finding a veterinarian to provide a CVI or if animals are delivered without one.",

The FDA's current standards only require access to the outdoors, without specifying a minimum time. This has allowed some egg producers to make \"pasture-raised\" claims without meeting USDA's more stringent requirements.\n\nThe petition was filed in October 2022. If approved, the updated FDA labeling rules could impact approximately 9% of the U.S. egg supply, which is currently marketed as \"pasture-raised.\" This change would provide more clarity for consumers about the living conditions of hens producing \"pasture-raised\" eggs.",

      "summary": "Cargill is closing its meat processing facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, affecting 221 employees. The layoffs will begin on April 11, and the beef plant is expected to close around May 31. The closure is due to a decline in cattle supply in the region, which has made the plant's operations uncompetitive. Cargill stated that the closure is part of an ongoing effort to optimize their beef business in North America. Farmers in the region may face challenges finding alternative markets for their cattle, and the closure will likely have a significant impact on the local economy.",

      "summary": "The main news from the article is that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced a new $500 million grant program to support sustainable farming practices. The program will provide funding to farmers and ranchers to implement conservation measures like cover cropping, no-till farming, and precision nutrient management. The goal is to help farmers reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build soil health.\n\nThe USDA will begin accepting applications for the program on March 1, 2026, and the deadline to apply is May 31, 2026. Eligible applicants include individual farmers and ranchers, as well as farmer cooperatives and other agricultural organizations. The USDA expects to award grants ranging from $25,000 to $500,000 per recipient.\n\nThe new grant program is part of the Biden administration's broader effort to address climate change in the agriculture sector. According to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, \"This investment will help farmers and ranchers lead the way in adopting practices that reduce emissions, increase carbon sequestration, and build resilience on their operations.\"\n\nExperts say the program could have significant impacts for farmers, helping them save money on inputs, improve soil health, and potentially earn additional income from carbon credits. Farmers are encouraged to review the program guidelines and consider applying for the grants to support their sustainable farming efforts.",

This is a common issue in late winter/early spring.\n\n- Factors increasing risk of winterkill include: lack of insulating snow cover, poor fall growth, low potassium fertility, and freeze-thaw cycles leading to frost heaving.\n\n- To assess damage, look for brown, dead plants while the surrounding pasture greens up. Frost heaving will create uneven soil surface and lifted plant crowns.\n\n- Damage from frost heaving can be deceptive as plants may green up initially but then die once upper soil moisture is depleted.\n\n- Identifying damaged areas early is important to plan management activities like interseeding to aid pasture recovery.\n\n- Expert quoted is Emma Matcham, assistant professor at Ohio State University's Horticulture and Crop Science Department.",

Farmer Eli Mack has incorporated more trees on his 50-head beef cattle operation, Mack Farms, in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. Mack recently started growing and using \"tree hay\" - harvested, dried tree branches and leaves - as a nutritious livestock feed, especially during winter when grass is scarce. Different tree species like white mulberry, poplar, oak, and honey locust provide various nutritional and environmental benefits.\n\nWhile agroforestry was long overlooked, it is becoming more accepted today. Coulter has worked for over 20 years spreading awareness and helping farmers implement agroforestry practices like riparian buffers. Her work has protected water, built soil, and supported biodiversity. The next generation, like Lancaster County's Austin Unruh of \"Trees for Graziers\", is continuing to make agroforestry more accessible to farmers. Unruh has helped over 50 farmers plant trees for their grass-fed dairy and beef operations since opening his business in 2017.",

Iowa currently has the 2nd highest cancer incidence rate in the U.S., which is rising while the national rate is falling. Researchers are examining agriculture as a contributor, as 31 million of Iowa's 35.7 million acres are intensively farmed.\n\nThe report also touts potential benefits of E15 like sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture/storage, but these are described as \"potential\" and face significant obstacles like lack of public support for CO2 pipelines and over $10 billion in estimated federal subsidies. \n\nThe article argues the simplest solution is for farmers to plant something other than corn, as there is no requirement to grow one crop.

      "summary": "Case IH, the agricultural equipment manufacturer, has debuted a patriotic-themed Heartland Magnum tractor to commemorate the 250th anniversary of America's founding. The tractor was built at the company's facility in Racine, Wisconsin and features a stars-and-stripes paint scheme designed by a local artist. \n\nThe design incorporates strategic contour lines that not only depict the land around Racine, but also relate to the data and precision farming tools used by farmers. Other subtle design elements, like the red rims on the wheels, connect the Heartland Magnum to Case IH's autonomous tractor concept from a decade ago.\n\nThis special-edition tractor will be on display at trade shows and events around the country throughout 2026, the year of America's 250th birthday. Matt Booms, a tractor product specialist with Case IH, stated that the Heartland Magnum is a \"tribute to Americana, to the hardworking men and women who use these machines, as well as to the hardworking men and women that build these machines and engineer them.\"",

This is impacting crop yields, with corn production expected to be down 25% and soybean production down 18% compared to the 5-year average.\n\n- Beef cattle prices have risen 12% over the past 6 months, reaching a record high of $1.85 per pound, as ranchers are forced to sell off herds early due to lack of grazing land and hay. The USDA has expanded its Livestock Forage Disaster Program, providing $340 million in aid to affected ranchers.\n\n- The USDA has also announced a new $500 million grant program to help farmers adopt drought-resistant crops and precision irrigation technologies. Applications are due by April 30, 2026.\n\n- In other news, the American Farm Bureau has called on Congress to pass disaster relief legislation, noting that over 100 counties across 8 states have been declared federal disaster areas due to the ongoing drought.\n\n- Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller stated that the drought is \"the worst I've seen in my 40 years working in this industry\" and urged farmers to work closely with extension services to manage their operations.",

Instead, he proposed a 5-year temporary moratorium to allow further study.\n\nThe South Dakota Cattlemen's Association opposed the bill, fearing it could lead to other states restricting South Dakota's agricultural products. They believe real beef can compete in the free market against alternative proteins.\n\nIn 2025, South Dakota passed a law requiring clear labeling of cell-cultured protein products. The state also prohibited using any state funds for these products.\n\nWhile the banned products are not yet in grocery stores, the Cattlemen's Association believes they will likely have a limited market impact over time, similar to other alternative protein products.\n\nThe South Dakota Stockgrowers Association, which supported the original bill, disagrees with Rhoden's veto but will support the proposed 5-year moratorium.",

      "summary": "North Dakota farmers will face greater risk this year as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency has eliminated the extra \"buy-up\" coverage option for prevented planting insurance. \n\nFrom 2010 to 2024, the extra prevented planting coverage led to $3.18 billion in payments for North Dakota producers, more than any other state. This option allowed farmers to insure against years when weather prevents them from planting a crop.\n\nWithout this option in 2026, North Dakota farmers like Justin Quandt, who farms near Oakes, will have less protection against wet spring conditions that can leave some of their fields unplantable. Quandt's family normally invests in the additional prevented planting coverage, which requires insuring all acres in a county.\n\nThe North Dakota Farmers Union president Matt Perdue said the agency's decision is disappointing, as the recent farm bill had expanded federal crop insurance in other ways. However, an NDSU study concluded that the improvements will not outweigh the loss of the extra prevented planting coverage for North Dakota.\n\nSenators, including John Hoeven of North Dakota, have asked the USDA to undo the prevented planting changes for 2027 and beyond \"to help provide a layer of certainty when disasters beyond their control render them unable to plant a crop.\" \n\nFarmers face a March 15 deadline to make 2026 crop insurance purchases. Insurance agent Bethany Rentz hopes the USDA will bring back the extra prevented planting coverage based on pushback from other affected states.",

Bee populations, including the endangered rusty patch bumblebee, have seen dramatic declines across North America due to factors like habitat loss, climate change, and disease.\n\n3. Restoring pollinator habitat on agricultural landscapes is important, and can be done cost-effectively. Planting a diverse mix of flowering plants, even in small areas, can support a variety of bee species.\n\n4. Research shows that the amount of surrounding agricultural land or size of the habitat area does not significantly impact bee diversity and abundance, as long as there are sufficient floral resources.\n\n5. Integrating pollinator habitat into croplands can have benefits for natural pest control, and can even improve yields for self-pollinating crops like soybeans.\n\n6. Funding sources and conservation programs may be available to assist farmers in establishing and maintaining pollinator habitat.\n\n7. Minnesota alone has around 525 species of bees, ranging from tiny to large bumblebees. Native bee species, including ground-nesting bees, are the focus of research at the University of Minnesota Bee Lab.",

The true indicator of content effectiveness is now attention time - how long a user spends meaningfully engaged with the content.\n\nAgWeb.com recently underwent a redesign to increase user attention and engagement. The results show:\n- 54% increase in readers reaching 75% of an article\n- 21% increase in readers reaching 90% of an article\n- 33% increase in daily article pageviews per mobile user\n\nThe article cites data that 79% of online users scan content rather than reading word-for-word, and most only absorb around 28% of page text. AgWeb's redesign aimed to simplify layouts and guide deeper engagement.\n\nAttention time is a better metric than CTR because it shows if users stayed with the content, scrolled with purpose, consumed multiple articles, and were in an active, focused mindset. High-attention environments deliver stronger results for advertisers, as their brand is present during engaged moments.\n\nThe improvements on AgWeb are said to directly translate to more value for brands, providing more time with content, more content consumed per session, higher quality impressions, and better alignment with how farmers search today.

Kale, cabbage, and spinach can handle cold well even in their early stages. Onions, especially bulbing onions, benefit from the long maturation period. Leafy greens like kale, collards, and chard are also excellent choices.\n\nFor flowers, the article recommends perennials like pansies, echinacea, snapdragons, larkspur, and scabiosa. These flowers often need a period of cold stratification, which is provided by the winter sowing method.\n\nThe article provides specific variety recommendations for some of the vegetables and flowers, such as 'Carex' cabbage, 'Avon' spinach, and different types of snapdragons. It also discusses the ideal growing conditions for long-day, short-day, and intermediate-day onions.\n\nOverall, the winter sowing method allows farmers to get a head start on the growing season and produce hardier, more mature plants come spring.

Prairie Strips: Planting 10-25% of farmland in prairie strips can attract beneficial predators, improve soil nutrients, and boost yields by supporting pollinators and pest-controlling insects.\n\n2. Low Tilling: Reducing tillage and using cover crops can improve soil structure and support greater biodiversity above and below ground.\n\n3. Regenerative Grazing: Rotating livestock and using native plants, fire, and mowing can maintain healthy pastures and provide habitat for local species, especially in areas with prairie or forest ecosystems. \n\n4. Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Attracting beneficial insects through diverse plantings and cultural practices can reduce reliance on harmful pesticides.\n\n5. Conservation Easements: Partnering with land trusts to establish conservation easements can protect natural resources and provide tax benefits for farmers with large landholdings.\n\nImplementing these strategies, even partially, can have significant positive impacts on biodiversity and farm productivity by working with natural systems rather than against them. Experts emphasize that farming is as much for humans as it is a constant reminder of the laws of the natural world, and the more farmers can see their land as part of a larger ecosystem, the more sustainable their agriculture can become.",

      "summary": "Key Findings:\n- Tar spot, a fungal disease in corn, has been spreading in the U.S. since it was first detected in 2015. It has now reached 16 states and Ontario, Canada.\n- Purdue researchers are taking an interdisciplinary approach, combining agricultural and engineering methods, to study the dynamics of tar spot and develop ways to monitor and assess the disease.\n- The research team is using a mix of statistics, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, artificial intelligence, and computer vision, along with stakeholder feedback, to better understand tar spot.\n- The research is funded by two USDA grants totaling nearly $1.1 million.\n- The researchers are collaborating with experts from Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S.\n- Previous work by the team has included developing a digital method to quantify tar spot in corn, with promising results, but some inaccuracies still need to be addressed.\n- The team is also exploring the use of drone imagery and weather data, along with traditional statistical methods, to capture details about the tar spot pathosystem.\n\nKey Numbers/Statistics:\n- Tar spot was first detected in the U.S. in 2015, affecting 2 of Indiana's 92 counties.\n- By 2022, the fungus had extended to 16 states and Ontario, Canada, as well as 15 other countries in Central and South America, the Caribbean, and U.S. territories.\n- The research is funded by two USDA grants totaling nearly $1.1 million.\n\nKey Dates/Deadlines:\n- The article was published on August 1, 2024.\n\nKey Names/Organizations/Programs:\n- Purdue University\n- C.D. Cruz, associate professor of botany and plant pathology\n- Mohammad Jahanshahi, associate professor in the Lyles School of Civil and Construction Engineering and the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n- Mariela Fernández-Campos, PhD student in botany and plant pathology\n- Yu-Ting Huang, postdoctoral research associate in civil engineering\n- Darcy Telenko, associate professor of botany and plant pathology\n- Brenden Lane, graduate student in C.D.
