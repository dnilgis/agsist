Jason Smith, Rep. David Schweikert, and Rep. Tracey Mann, sent a letter to FFA CEO Scott Stump demanding documents and answers related to the partnership with Syngenta Group. They stated that this partnership raises concerns about the FFA's relationship with \"foreign adversaries\" and prioritizing \"woke policies over your mission,\" which they believe could jeopardize the organization's tax-exempt status.\n\nThe FFA has reaffirmed its commitment to remaining nonpartisan and free from donor influence, stating that it \"does not and cannot advocate the views for any donor or sponsor.\" However, the organization has declined to provide additional details, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation.\n\nThe inquiry comes amid heightened scrutiny from Congress over partnerships between U.S.-based nonprofits and companies with foreign ownership ties. The lawmakers have emphasized the importance of the FFA's mission in educating America's youth and ensuring the future of American farming, and they are working with the Trump Administration to prioritize farm and food security within the national security infrastructure.",

      "summary": "Mud depth significantly increases cow energy requirements by up to 30%, while reducing feed intake by 15-30%. This can lead to lower milk production, poor body condition, and reduced calf health. \n\nResearch from Ohio State University found that cows in muddy conditions require an additional 1.8 Mcal Net Energy/day or 2.5 lbs. of corn to maintain adequate body condition. To account for this, the most cost-effective solution is to supplement cows with whole shelled corn, which costs $0.25 more per head per day at $7/bushel.\n\nUnrolling large round hay bales can provide a place for calves to lay in muddy conditions, but has higher waste. Experts recommend only unrolling what can be consumed in a single day. \n\nThe article notes that mud season is becoming more prolonged in Ohio and the Eastern Cornbelt due to shifting rainfall patterns, with springs becoming warmer and wetter over time.

This can lead to more available nitrogen for plant growth at a lower cost than fertilizers, boosting pasture productivity and protein levels. \n\nThe optimal time for frost seeding in Ohio is typically during February, when there are enough freeze-thaw cycles. Seeding can be done on top of snow, but avoid deep snow (over 6 inches) which can lead to seed being washed away. Ideal conditions are 2 inches of snow or less on gentle slopes.\n\nRecommended seeding rates are 3-4 lbs/acre for red clover, 1-3 lbs/acre for white/ladino clover, and 2-4 lbs/acre for birdsfoot trefoil. Grass species like annual ryegrass and orchardgrass can also be frost seeded. Avoid grazing frost-seeded areas for the first few months to allow the young legume seedlings to establish. Use caution with spring herbicides, as many will kill the newly introduced legumes.\n\nThe article is written by Emma Matcham, an assistant professor at Ohio State University's Department of Horticulture and Crop Science, who can be reached at Matcham.3@osu.edu.",

      "summary": "The U.S. protein sector is facing significant challenges due to disruptions in the supply of feed-grade vitamins and amino acids. According to IFEEDER's Laura Moody and Dr. Yuan-Tia Hong, these supply chain issues are primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to production slowdowns and transportation bottlenecks.\n\nThe shortages are impacting the availability of key nutrients such as lysine, methionine, and vitamins A, D3, and E. Prices for these essential feed ingredients have increased substantially, with lysine costs up 70% and methionine costs up 100% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThese nutrient shortages are forcing livestock and poultry producers to adjust their feed formulations, leading to increased production costs. Broiler producers, for example, are facing a 10-15% increase in feed costs, while pork producers are seeing a 20-25% increase.\n\nThe impacts are being felt across the protein sector, with dairy, beef, and aquaculture producers also facing challenges in securing the necessary feed ingredients. The situation is particularly dire for smaller and medium-sized producers, who are more vulnerable to these supply chain disruptions.\n\nTo mitigate the impact, IFEEDER and industry experts are recommending that producers work closely with their nutritionists and feed suppliers to optimize their feed formulations and explore alternative ingredient sources. They also advise producers to build up their feed inventory to ensure a buffer against future supply chain disruptions.\n\nIn the long term, the industry is calling for increased investment in domestic production and supply chain resilience to reduce reliance on international sources and improve the stability of the U.S. protein sector's feed supply.",

This is a crucial step towards the product's conditional licensure by the USDA.\n\nNecrotic enteritis is a costly disease affecting broiler production, leading to over $6 billion in annual losses globally. BiomEdit's biologic aims to provide an alternative to antibiotics for managing this condition. The company received a $1.5 million grant from the USDA in 2021 to support the development of this innovative product.\n\nThe final safety trial will involve 100,000 broilers across multiple commercial farms in the United States. Data collected during the trial will be used to support BiomEdit's application for USDA conditional licensure, which would allow the biologic to be used by poultry producers while the company continues its research for full licensure.\n\nDr. Kayla Price, BiomEdit's Chief Scientific Officer, stated that the successful completion of this trial would be a significant milestone in the company's efforts to provide farmers with a new tool to manage necrotic enteritis without relying on antibiotics.",

The goal is to fill in gaps in knowledge about firefly populations across Pennsylvania to help inform policies for better protection. The team will examine museum collections and conduct field surveys during the peak firefly season.\n\nThe inventory will focus on areas like the Allegheny National Forest, which is known for high firefly populations. Methods will include using fly intercept traps and recording male firefly flight patterns. However, definitive species identification requires dissecting firefly genitalia.\n\nThe inventory is prompted by concerns about potential firefly declines, as they are becoming harder to find outside of protected natural areas. Pennsylvania hosts multiple popular firefly festivals, including the annual Pennsylvania Firefly Festival in Tionesta, which has grown rapidly in attendance since 2016.\n\nOrganizers Peggy and Ken Butler now use a lottery system to limit the festival to 75 attendees for two nighttime tours.

Harvestone Low Carbon Partners is exploring trucking carbon dioxide emissions from its Dakota Spirit ethanol plant near Jamestown, North Dakota, about 160 miles west for underground storage.\n\n2. The company requested a $20 million loan from North Dakota's Clean Sustainable Energy Authority (CSEA) in late January for its $95 million project, but the CSEA board voted against providing the funding.\n\n3. Harvestone already operates a carbon storage facility at its Blue Flint ethanol plant near Underwood, North Dakota, where the CO2 has been pumped underground into the Broom Creek Formation since 2023.\n\n4. Transporting CO2 by truck would not be a new practice, but the scale Harvestone is considering is. They plan to capture and store 230,000 metric tons of CO2 annually.\n\n5. Building a pipeline to transport Dakota Spirit's emissions would be expensive, as a 160-mile pipeline would only move about 1,430 metric tons of CO2 per mile, compared to Summit's 2,500-mile pipeline which would move about 7,200 metric tons per mile.\n\n6. Harvestone has an engineering, procurement and construction agreement with Minnesota-based McGough for the project, with a \"guaranteed substantial complete\" date in January 2027 and full commercial operations planned for later that year.\n\n7. The potential for carbon storage in eastern North Dakota is limited due to the area's geology, so some form of transportation would be needed if companies want to capture, store or use industrial emissions from the region.",

      "summary": "These crops feed the soil, support microorganisms, sequester carbon, and protect against erosion - providing economic benefits for farms. \n\nThe 5 cover crops recommended to plant in February are:\n\n1. Spinach - Increases good bacteria and fungi in the soil, especially beneficial for later planting of peppers. Requires soil temperature of at least 40°F.\n\n2. Kale - Feeds the soil, people, livestock, and can be a specialty market crop. Needs slightly warmer soil of at least 45°F. Resistant varieties recommended in disease-prone areas.\n\n3. Daikon radish - Deep taproots break up compacted soil and scavenge leftover nitrogen. Requires soil temperature of at least 65°F.\n\n4. Oats - Grow quickly to prevent weed growth and form beneficial relationships with fungi. Can be sown with peas for nitrogen fixing. Tolerate temperatures down to 20°F.\n\n5. Buckwheat - A quick-maturing \"phosphorus scavenger\" that conditions poor soil. Can be used as a mulch after flowering.\n\nFarmers should consider their local climate and use low tunnels if needed to provide extra warmth and protection for the cover crops during cold weather. Planting these cover crops can boost yields of subsequent spring crops.",

The Index of Current Conditions increased by 10 points to 100, and the Index of Future Expectations rose 7 points to 119.\n\nKey statistics:\n- Eastern Corn Belt cash prices fell 11% and 5% for corn and soybeans, respectively, from mid-June to mid-July.\n- 34% of farmers cited high input costs as their biggest concern, and 29% cited the risk of lower crop and livestock prices.\n- The Farm Financial Performance Index dropped 4 points in July to 81, 6 points lower than in July 2023.\n- The Farm Capital Investment Index rose 6 points in July to 38, though it remains 7 points lower than in July 2023.\n- The Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index rose to 118 from 115 in June, while the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index dropped 6 points to 146.\n- 72% of crop farmer respondents expect cash rental rates to remain roughly the same as in 2024, with the remaining respondents nearly evenly divided between expecting an increase or a decline.\n\nThe survey was conducted from July 15-19, 2024. The improvement in sentiment was attributed to fewer respondents reporting worsened conditions compared to a year ago and a decrease in those expecting negative future outcomes, despite concerns about weakening commodity prices and high input costs.",

      "summary": "Purdue researchers are adopting an interdisciplinary approach to assess the emerging tar spot disease in corn. The research team, led by C.D. Cruz, associate professor of botany and plant pathology, is using a mix of statistical, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, artificial intelligence, and computer vision methods to understand the dynamics of tar spot in corn.\n\nThe research is funded by two grants totaling nearly $1.1 million from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The team is collaborating with researchers from Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S.\n\nThe researchers have developed a digital method called the stromata contouring detection algorithm (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn. They have tested the algorithm under field conditions and found it to be successful in quantifying trends, but some inaccuracies persist in fully automated scenarios. The team is now refining their training methods to improve the model's accuracy and performance.\n\nAnother research effort includes the laboratory of Purdue's Mohammad Jahanshahi, associate professor in the Lyles School of Civil and Construction Engineering and the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Jahanshahi and Cruz, along with their students, are working on a proof-of-concept data fusion project that integrates drone imagery and weather data to capture crucial details about the tar spot pathosystem.\n\nThe researchers aim to quantify and model tar spot epidemics in production-style fields using disease observations and drone-based imagery. Ultimately, the team wants to quantify and model tar spot severity by referencing and integrating imagery with spatial and temporal data.\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of the project can place greater time demands on the researchers, but it also leads to better problem-solving as each person brings their own expertise to the table.",

Wheat condition is rated 79% good-to-excellent, higher than the 5-year average of 71%.\n\nExperts Damon Smith and Shawn Conley from the University of Wisconsin-Madison recommend that farmers monitor their wheat closely for disease and insect pressure as the crop advances rapidly. They advise applying fungicides at flag leaf emergence to protect against Fusarium head blight and other diseases.\n\nThe early wheat development is due to warmer than average temperatures in March and April. This accelerated growth could lead to earlier wheat harvest, potentially impacting management of other summer crops. Farmers should adjust plans accordingly and be prepared to shift fieldwork schedules as needed.",

Yield potential - Replanted soybeans may yield 5-10% less than the original stand. Yield loss is higher for replanting beyond June 1st.\n\n2. Maturity - Replanted soybeans will be 7-10 days later to maturity. This can impact harvest timing and drying costs.\n\n3. Weed control - Replanting provides a chance to change herbicide programs and manage weeds more effectively.\n\n4. Seed quality - Germination and vigor of replacement seed should be checked. Seed treatments may be needed.\n\n5. Planting date - Ideal replanting dates are before June 1st in northern climates. Yields drop significantly for plantings after June 15th.\n\n6. Stand uniformity - Uneven stands can impact harvestability and yield. Aim for a uniform 100,000-150,000 plants/acre.\n\nShawn P. Conley, Soybean and Small Grains Specialist at UW-Madison, recommends carefully evaluating these factors before deciding to replant a soybean field.",
