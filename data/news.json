USDA will reallocate 100 million sterile flies per week to a new dispersal area about 50 miles into Texas along the border with Tamaulipas, Mexico. The northernmost active NWS case in Mexico is 200 miles from the U.S. border, but cases continue to spread southward. \n\nSterile insect technique, combined with surveillance, movement restrictions, and outreach, is an effective tool to control and eradicate NWS. Female NWS flies only mate once, so mating with sterile males results in unfertilized eggs. USDA will dye the sterile pupae so officials can distinguish sterile flies from wild ones in traps. \n\nUSDA is also enforcing import protocols, conducting ongoing surveillance and trapping along the border, investing in NWS innovation, and supporting response efforts in Mexico and Central America. A recent case of a horse from Argentina testing positive for NWS at a Florida import facility shows the importance of these import protocols.\n\nTo date, over 42,000 flies from border traps have been tested with no NWS detections. USDA is also inspecting over 9,300 wild animals with no signs of NWS. However, USDA is urging livestock and pet owners to remain vigilant and report any suspicious signs to state/USDA officials. NWS can infest livestock, pets, and even humans through open wounds.",

The varieties offer up to 30% higher yield potential compared to SCN-susceptible soybeans. Corteva is also expanding its SCN-resistant offerings, with 60 new SCN-resistant varieties planned for 2023.\n\nThe SCN Coalition, a public-private partnership, recommends that farmers test their fields for SCN and rotate resistant soybean varieties every year to manage the pest. Estimates show SCN is present in over 70% of U.S. soybean fields, making effective management critical.\n\nExperts emphasize the importance of an integrated approach, using resistant varieties along with other tactics like crop rotation and nematode-protectant seed treatments.

      "summary": "The main news is that the government has announced a new $5 billion program to support sustainable farming practices. The program will provide direct payments to farmers who adopt climate-friendly methods like reduced tillage, cover cropping, and precision nutrient management. Eligible farmers can receive up to $50 per acre, with a maximum of 500 acres per farm. The program will run for 5 years, from 2026 to 2030. \n\nAccording to the Secretary of Agriculture, the goal is to enroll 50 million acres in the program by 2030, which would reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by 10% compared to current levels. Farmers groups have welcomed the initiative, with the Sustainable Farming Association saying it will help accelerate the transition to more resilient and environmentally-sound farming practices. Applications for the program will be accepted starting June 1, 2026, with the first payments going out in Fall 2026.",

Milking Routine: Establish a consistent milking routine, milking at the same times each day. This reduces stress on cows and improves milk letdown.\n\n3. Udder Preparation: Properly clean and stimulate cows' udders before milking to maximize milk flow and minimize risk of mastitis.\n\n4. Milking Time: Aim to complete milking within 5-7 minutes per cow to avoid over-milking and udder damage.\n\n5. Cow Health Monitoring: Regularly monitor cows for signs of illness, lameness, or other issues. Address problems promptly to maintain herd health and productivity.\n\n6. Nutrition: Provide a balanced, high-quality diet to support cow health, milk production, and fertility.\n\n7. Facilities Upkeep: Keep milking parlors, housing, and other facilities clean and well-maintained to promote cow comfort and hygiene.\n\nBy implementing these practical tips, small and medium dairy farmers in India can improve milking efficiency, cow health, and overall farm productivity.

This recent cold snap will have varying impacts on different pest insects.\n\nFor soybean aphids, the southern half of the state and Red River Valley will see very little mortality, while north-central and northeast MN will see 50-95% mortality. This means soybean aphids may be slower to build up in northern areas, but will still pose a risk requiring scouting.\n\nFor alfalfa weevil, the minimum 2-inch soil temperature of 15.4°F at the West Central Research Center suggests little mortality is expected this year. Slightly more northern areas may see slight reductions in weevil pressure.\n\nCorn rootworm forecasting is more complex, as their eggs overwinter deeper in the soil. At the Research Center, 4-inch and 8-inch soil temps only reached 19.4°F and 23.0°F respectively, so not much acute mortality is expected.\n\nFor emerald ash borer, the northern half of MN is predicted to see 25%+ mortality, which could help slow its spread. But the southern half, including the southeast and Fargo, ND, will only see around 10% mortality.\n\nThe article notes that overwintering is just one factor affecting pest populations, and scouting, resistant varieties, and other management strategies will still be important in 2026.",

Even a few degrees can significantly impact their health and productivity.\n\n- Experts recommend providing at least 1 pound of extra feed per 100 lbs of body weight for every 10°F below the critical temperature of 32°F. This can amount to an additional 10-15 lbs of feed per day for a 1,200 lb cow.\n\n- Cattle need protection from wind, rain, and snow. Windbreaks, shelters, and access to dry bedding are essential. Lack of shelter can lead to reduced weight gain, milk production, and reproductive performance.\n\n- Cattle are more susceptible to cold stress in wet conditions. Dry hair coats provide much better insulation than wet, matted hair.\n\n- Pregnancy and lactation increase a cow's energy needs in cold weather. Extra attention should be paid to pregnant and nursing cows.\n\n- Severe cold can also lead to frostbite, particularly on the ears, tail, and teats. Monitoring cattle and providing treatment is important.\n\nThe article emphasizes the importance of proactive management to protect cattle during cold winter conditions for their health, productivity, and profitability on the farm.",

The release will take place in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, near the Mexico border. \n\nThe New World Screwworm is a significant threat to the livestock industry, as it can infect open wounds in animals and cause significant damage and even death. In 2016, a screwworm outbreak in the Florida Keys resulted in the deaths of 135 endangered Key deer.\n\nThe USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will oversee the release of the sterile male flies, which will compete with wild male screwworm flies to mate with female flies. This will reduce the population of the pest and help protect Texas livestock.\n\nThe USDA is investing $4.5 million in the program, which will release up to 40 million sterile flies per week over the next two years. The goal is to eliminate the New World Screwworm from the region and prevent it from spreading into the United States.\n\nExperts say the release of sterile flies is an effective method of controlling the screwworm population, as it interrupts the pest's reproduction cycle without the use of pesticides. This approach has been successfully used in other regions to eradicate the New World Screwworm.\n\nThe USDA is urging Texas livestock producers to closely monitor their animals for any signs of screwworm infestation and to report any suspected cases to their local veterinarian or the APHIS office.",

The article highlights the financial challenges faced by dairy farmers, with the average farm milk price in the U.S. being $17.50 per hundredweight (cwt) in 2022, while the cost of production is around $24 per cwt. This disparity has led many dairy farmers to depend on off-farm income to keep their farms afloat. \n\nThe article cites a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that found the median income for farm households in 2020 was $87,658, with 82% of that income coming from off-farm sources. This highlights the importance of non-farm employment for the financial viability of many dairy farms. \n\nThe article also mentions that the number of dairy farms in the U.S. has declined from over 650,000 in the 1970s to around 31,000 today, with the remaining farms becoming larger and more specialized. This consolidation has put pressure on smaller dairy farms, further emphasizing the need for off-farm income to supplement their farm earnings.\n\nThe article does not provide any specific recommendations or expert quotes, but the overall message is that the reliance on non-farm income is a crucial factor in the survival of the vast majority of U.S. dairy farms.",

      "summary": "S. government's regulations on the use of drones in agriculture. The main points are:\n\n- In 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implemented regulations that require drone operators to obtain a Part 107 commercial drone pilot license to use drones for any commercial purpose, including agriculture.\n\n- The regulations limit the weight of drones to under 55 pounds and restrict their use to visual line-of-sight operations only. Drones cannot be flown over people or beyond the operator's direct visual range.\n\n- These regulations have faced criticism from farmers and agricultural organizations, who argue that the restrictions make it difficult to use drones for beneficial applications like crop monitoring, precision spraying, and livestock management.\n\n- The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International estimates that the integration of drones into U.S. agriculture could generate over $82 billion in economic activity and create 100,000 new jobs by 2025.\n\n- However, the FAA maintains that the regulations are necessary to ensure public safety and prevent misuse of drone technology.\n\n- Some experts suggest that working with the FAA to develop more flexible regulations for agricultural drone use could be a way forward. This could involve establishing specific drone corridors or testing programs to demonstrate the benefits of agricultural drone applications.\n\nThe article highlights the ongoing tension between the desire to utilize drone technology in agriculture and the government's efforts to regulate its use for safety and security reasons. Resolving this issue could have significant economic implications for the agricultural sector.",

Crop insurance was also made more affordable, saving farmers over $400 million annually.\n\nTo lower farmers' costs, the administration is targeting price fixing and anti-competitive behavior in input markets like seed, fertilizer and equipment. It has also reformed the H-2A agricultural worker program, providing over $2 billion in annual savings.\n\nThe USDA plans to purchase up to $970 million in healthy, U.S.-grown commodities this year. Additionally, the administration announced $12 billion in Farmer Bridge Payments to help producers weather market disruptions and volatility.\n\nThe administration is also expanding global market access for American agriculture through new trade deals with over 15 countries. Ohio's farm exports support income, jobs and economic growth.\n\nDon Jones, Ohio FSA Executive Director, states the Trump administration's \"Farmers First\" agenda is delivering real relief, stronger safety nets, and expanded markets - with more progress to come.",

In contrast, farmers remained reluctant to sell corn and wheat, with only 35% and 30% of those crops sold by December, respectively. Corn and wheat prices remained at multi-year lows, discouraging farmers from selling.

Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller welcomed the governor's declaration, stating it gives the task force greater authority, resources, and speed to confront the growing threat.\n\n5. Commissioner Miller has urged heightened surveillance and proactive steps by Texas producers, especially those in border regions, to protect their livestock, pets, and wildlife.\n\n6. Texas has been cooperating with the USDA and working on the front lines of NWS prevention and detection. In June 2025, Governor Abbott directed the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Texas Animal Health Commission to take action.\n\n7. The goal is to fully eradicate the NWS pest if it reaches Texas, as it poses a serious risk to the state's livestock industry.",

From 2015-2018, the average heifer retention rate was 21%.\n\n- Nalivka expects cattle numbers to continue tightening in 2026 and 2027, with a 2% smaller 2025 calf crop. This, combined with continued strong beef demand, should support cattle prices at or above the 2025 third quarter peak.\n\n- Nalivka has greater confidence in the actual cattle slaughter data reported to USDA by packers, compared to the annual survey-based inventory numbers.",

The total economic impact of Super Bowl LX chicken wing consumption is estimated at $3.52 billion. \n\n\"Chicken wing lovers across the country are getting their taste buds ready for Super Bowl LX,\" said NCC spokesman Tom Super. He noted that while supplies are expected to be adequate, some fans may encounter higher prices or limited availability due to ongoing supply chain challenges.\n\nThe NCC recommends that fans order wings early, be flexible on flavor preferences, and consider alternate wing-like products like boneless wings or chicken tenders if necessary.

The rule, originally slated to begin on February 1, 2026, aimed to strengthen enforcement of the Horse Protection Act to stop the practice of soring. \n\nThe delay is due to three main factors:\n1. A federal district court in the Northern District of Texas vacated several key provisions of the 2024 rule in January 2025.\n2. Another lawsuit challenged existing HPA regulations and policies in June-August 2025, leading to a preliminary injunction that added more uncertainty.\n3. A House Committee Report in November 2025 directed APHIS to withdraw the 2024 final rule, further complicating the regulatory path forward.\n\nAPHIS leadership cited the need to avoid a confusing \"patchwork\" of rules, as implementing only the surviving pieces while major provisions remain under litigation would be unworkable for the industry and inspectors. \n\nOne tangible effect of the delay is that horse show managers won't have to begin new recordkeeping and reporting requirements in February 2026 as originally planned, providing more regulatory certainty for exhibitors, managers, and owners in the near term.",

The fine was related to former executives artificially inflating the value of ADM's Nutrition business, which the company had touted as a major profit driver. \n\nThe SEC found that as the Nutrition business failed to meet profit projections, ADM's former Chief Financial Officer Vikram Luthar shifted funds from other parts of the company to make Nutrition appear to be performing better. Luthar, along with two other executives, were named in the SEC complaint for their roles in the accounting fraud.\n\nWhile the SEC fined ADM, the U.S. Department of Justice dropped its criminal investigation into the company in January 2026. However, an ADM investor has an ongoing lawsuit against the company over the fraudulent accounting.\n\nADM's Nutrition business was considered a key metric for investors, with the company consistently promising 15-20% annual profit growth. This led to financial incentives for executives across the company to help the Nutrition unit meet its targets, even at the expense of other business units.\n\nThe fraud began in 2019 before Luthar's promotion to Nutrition CFO, and continued as he took a \"central role\" in shifting profits to artificially boost the unit's performance. This included retroactively locking in lower commodity prices to meet forecasts.\n\nIn 2022, Luthar was promoted to ADM's overall CFO, receiving a $130,000 bonus tied in part to Nutrition's inflated results. The SEC has filed a complaint against Luthar, while the other two implicated executives have agreed to pay back investor gains from the scheme.\n\nThe ADM case underscores the pressure agribusiness firms can face to meet investor growth expectations, and the compliance risks that can arise from aggressive financial targets and executive compensation practices.",

This large short position suggests potential for sharp price rallies if something changes, such as stronger demand or tightening supply.\n\n- In the wheat market, managed money remains short across all classes, but the pace of new selling has slowed, indicating funds are comfortable with their current positions and reducing downside momentum.\n\n- In the soybean complex, managed money has turned flat in soybeans, suggesting uncertainty about the market direction. However, in soybean oil, funds have been actively covering shorts, contributing to the rally in that market.\n\n- Canola is another market where managed money holds a large short position, but they have started reducing those shorts, signaling potential volatility ahead.\n\n- The author emphasizes that understanding money flow helps explain price action and prevents emotional decision-making, even when markets don't behave as expected.

However, you own the equipment at the end of the loan period.\n- Leasing equipment has a lower initial investment, more flexible terms, and easier upgrades, but you don't own the equipment. Leasing may not be suitable for high-use equipment.\n- Renting equipment is the most flexible option, allowing use for a finite period, but is more expensive on a per-use basis. Renting can be good for trying new equipment.\n\nAdvice:\n- Calculate the full costs of each option, including interest rates, depreciation, payments, penalties, etc.\n- Consult your banker, extension office, accountant, and tax professional to get expert guidance on the best option for your farm's situation and finances.\n\nThe article was written by Lee Beers, an assistant professor and extension educator with Ohio State University Extension in Trumbull County.",

      "summary": "Bread was a staple food, often the only thing standing between settlers and starvation. Loaves were dense, hand-formed circular shapes, very different from today's commercial loaves. Two types of iron bread toasters were used in the fireplace - a \"kick toaster\" basket that rotated, and a swivel-mounted basket on a long rod. Blacksmiths often decoratively embellished these toasters.\n\nEarly coffee roasters consisted of a sheet metal cylinder with a crank, sitting on an iron base that held hot coals. Coffee roasting began in the 1500s in Africa/Middle East, and drum roasters were common in America through the 1800s. Coffee became a national obsession by the 1900s, replacing tea as the dominant drink.\n\nUnlike bread toasters, coffee roasters rarely had decorative elements. Fragile roasting cylinders often broke or rusted over time, and the bases were sometimes discarded when their original use was unrecognized.\n\nThe article provides historical context on the rise of coffee and tea consumption in America. It notes that while many pioneer cooking implements are now rare antiques, early coffee roasters are particularly hard to find today.",

      "summary": "S. states banning the use of trail cameras for hunting purposes, as they are seen to violate the principles of \"fair chase\" in hunting. In 2021, Arizona unanimously banned trail cameras for hunting, though they allow them for research, wildlife viewing, and property protection. Since then, several other states like Nevada, Alaska, Colorado, and Kansas have also introduced restrictions on the use of trail cameras during hunting seasons.\n\nThe main concerns raised are that trail cameras, especially those with live video feeds, give hunters an unfair technological advantage by allowing them to monitor animal movements and movements and ambush them, rather than relying on their own hunting skills and the animal's natural abilities to evade detection. This is seen to violate the \"Fair Chase Doctrine\" which emphasizes the development of individual hunting skills over reliance on overwhelming technology.\n\nSome specific statistics and details:\n- Trail cameras can now provide live wireless remote viewing of animal activity.\n- They are relatively inexpensive, easy to use, and readily available for various purposes like wildlife monitoring, research, farm protection, etc.\n- Delaware and Kansas have banned their use on public lands, citing issues of hunters \"staking claim\" to an area.\n- New Hampshire allows their use as long as no animal is taken the same day it is monitored.\n- The article cites concerns raised by organizations like the Pope and Young Club and Boone and Crockett Club about the use of electronic devices that can give hunters an unfair advantage over the game.\n\nIn terms of expert quotes, the article includes comments from Kurt Davis, the chairman of Arizona's Game and Fish Commission, and Daniel Pedrotti Jr., a member of Boone and Crockett's Hunter Ethics Sub-Committee, on the principles of fair chase and the line between acceptable and unacceptable technologies in hunting.\n\nThe overall recommendation is that while technology has its place in hunting, hunters need to exercise self-restraint and prioritize the development of their own skills over relying on gadgets that can give them an unfair advantage, as this goes against the core ethics and traditions of fair chase hunting.",

      "summary": "Prairie Strips: Planting 10-25% of farmland in prairie strips can boost yields, add soil nutrients, and attract beneficial insects and predators. This helps increase biodiversity above and below ground.\n\n2. Low Tilling: Reducing tillage and using cover crops instead can improve soil structure and increase biodiversity of insects and other organisms.\n\n3. Regenerative Grazing: Using rotational grazing models, planting native species, and using fire/mowing to manage invasive plants can increase available forage for livestock while providing habitat for local wildlife.\n\n4. Integrated Pest Management: Attracting beneficial insects through diverse plantings and cultural practices can reduce the need for harmful pesticides that damage biodiversity.\n\n5. Conservation Easements: Partnering with land trusts to establish conservation easements can protect natural resources and provide tax breaks for landowners.\n\nThe article states these strategies are \"worth it\" because they help maintain habitat for pollinators and pest-controlling animals, which reduces the need for costly inputs. Implementing these practices allows farms to better integrate with the surrounding natural ecosystem. Experts emphasize the importance of viewing the farm as part of a larger system to support biodiversity.",

Overall, 2025 was around 1 degree warmer than normal statewide. \n\nDecember 2025 had mixed precipitation, with central and northern Illinois seeing much higher than normal snowfall (up to 400% of normal), while eastern and southern Illinois were 1-4 inches drier than normal. 2025 was a very dry year overall, with only April and July seeing above normal rainfall. Champaign-Urbana had its second driest year on record in 2025 with only 24.5 inches of precipitation.\n\nLooking ahead, the weather outlook for the rest of January and February shows a temperature roller coaster, with a strong cold spell expected in late January along with more snow. As winter transitions to spring, forecasts indicate the current La Niña conditions will likely weaken and potentially transition to an El Niño by fall.\n\nThe article also mentions the WILL Ag radio programming, including the weekly Commodity Week panel discussion and the daily Closing Market Report.",

Scientists have been working since the 1990s to improve large-scale cultivation techniques.\n\nChlorella vulgaris is a microalga that replicates readily in optimal conditions of light, warmth, and nutrients. It is autotrophic, meaning it uses carbon dioxide and inorganic nitrogen to produce glucose. This makes it a sustainable and self-replicating food source.\n\nThe benefits of Chlorella vulgaris include its rich nutrient and protein content, as well as its ability to absorb heavy metals and act as a bioremediant. It is also being explored as a viable biofuel source alongside crops like soy and corn.\n\nChallenges in large-scale production include issues with algae buildup and lack of cleanup methods, as well as difficulties in scaling down production for smaller farms. Proposed solutions include using geothermal energy from natural hot springs, which provide the ideal 77°F (25°C) temperature range.\n\nWhile Chlorella vulgaris is successfully farmed in Japan, Taiwan, and Germany, further research is needed to solve production challenges and integrate it into smaller-scale farming operations. If these obstacles can be overcome, Chlorella vulgaris could become a highly sought-after \"superfood\" crop.",
