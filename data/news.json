According to Travis Meteer, a beef specialist with the University of Illinois Extension, current record prices in the cow-calf industry make it easy to generate profits. However, Meteer warns that this favorable situation may not last, advising producers to prioritize profitability while the opportunity exists. The low cattle supplies are the result of ongoing drought conditions and herd liquidation, leading to a decline in the national cattle herd.

      "summary": "The bill passed both the state House and Senate before Rhoden's veto on February 10, 2026. \n\nRhoden said he opposes banning these federally-approved and regulated products, arguing it would set a dangerous precedent of restricting products based on production method rather than safety. Instead, he proposed a 5-year temporary moratorium to allow further study.\n\nThe South Dakota Cattlemen's Association opposed the bill, fearing it could lead to other states restricting South Dakota's agricultural products. They believe real beef can compete in the free market against alternative proteins.\n\nIn 2025, South Dakota passed a law requiring clear labeling of cell-cultured protein products. The state also prohibited using any state funds for these products.\n\nWhile the banned products are not yet in grocery stores, the Cattlemen's Association believes they will likely have a limited market impact over time, similar to other alternative protein products.\n\nThe South Dakota Stockgrowers Association, which supported the original bill, disagrees with Rhoden's veto but will support the proposed 5-year moratorium.",

Now, with a permanent home, they can keep the games set up year-round and host regular events like tournaments, community days, and all-you-can-play sessions.\n\nThe arcade, dubbed the \"Church Arcade,\" features a mix of retro video games and pinball machines spanning decades, including some classic multiplayer cabinets. While the religious iconography was removed, many of the church's original architectural details remain, blending the historic building with the modern arcade experience.\n\nThe project has been generally well-received by the Duquesne community, with neighbors expressing excitement about the new local attraction.

But during cold winter weather and deep snow, cows may start eating fallen pine needles under trees, often coinciding with the last trimester of gestation when the fetus is most susceptible.\n\n- Studies have shown that once gestation reaches 42 days, herd pregnancy loss is usually only around 2% at most. However, sporadic late-term pregnancy losses can occur, and in rare cases, exposure to a toxin like pine needles can cause large-scale pregnancy losses.\n\n- Other pine tree species besides Ponderosa can also pose this threat. The issue has been recognized for at least the past 50 years in cattle production.\n\n- Cattle producers in less mountainous areas may be less familiar with this potential threat to beef cow pregnancies.",

Top sellers were Kinsey's Kookies and More, which sold 3,000 gobs, and Judy's Sweet Treats, which baked 1,050 gobs and won the \"best flavor\" award ($250 prize). The FARM BBQ and Bakery won \"best overall gob\" ($250).\n\nThe gob's origins trace back to the 1920s at the Harris-Boyer bakery in Johnstown, which trademarked the term in 1927. The treat became a local staple, with over 150,000 sold monthly in the 1960s. Theories on the gob's name include connections to sailors or coal miners. Amish women in eastern PA are also credited with inventing similar \"whoopie pies\" by using up excess cake batter.\n\nFor many attendees, the Gob Fest evokes fond memories and family traditions. Longtime vendor Judy Cooper learned to make gobs from her mother, while attendee Sam Uzelac recalled his mother sending him gobs while in the military. The Galleria's owner, Leo Karruli, hopes to continue the 20-year-old festival to support local businesses and preserve the region's gob legacy.",

This option allowed farmers to insure against years when weather prevents them from planting a crop.\n\nWithout this option in 2026, North Dakota farmers like Justin Quandt, who farms near Oakes, will have less protection against wet spring conditions that can leave some of their fields unplantable. Quandt's family normally invests in the additional prevented planting coverage, which requires insuring all acres in a county.\n\nThe North Dakota Farmers Union president Matt Perdue said the agency's decision is disappointing, as the recent farm bill had expanded federal crop insurance in other ways. However, an NDSU study concluded that the improvements will not outweigh the loss of the extra prevented planting coverage for North Dakota.\n\nSenators, including John Hoeven of North Dakota, have asked the USDA to undo the prevented planting changes for 2027 and beyond \"to help provide a layer of certainty when disasters beyond their control render them unable to plant a crop.\" \n\nFarmers face a March 15 deadline to make 2026 crop insurance purchases. Insurance agent Bethany Rentz hopes the USDA will bring back the extra prevented planting coverage based on pushback from other affected states.",

The system employs nail-shaped sensing probes that are wirelessly connected to a triple-ring antenna above the ground, allowing for passive and distributed monitoring of key parameters like moisture and salinity within the subsoil.\n\nThe HARVEST system is designed to be scalable and cost-effective, making it accessible for both small, independent farmers and large commercial operations. It was tested in a research cornfield at Purdue's Agronomy Center for Research and Education throughout a full growing season.\n\nThe invention addresses the need for efficient use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides, as applying uniform amounts across large fields can lead to significant waste. By providing deeper insights into subsoil conditions, HARVEST enables data-driven agricultural management that can reduce environmental impact, improve crop yields, and lower operational costs.\n\nThe research team, led by Purdue associate professor Rahim Rahimi, hopes to see HARVEST sensors deployed at scale, working in tandem with smart tractors, irrigation systems, and decision-support software to play a key role in reducing unnecessary input use, lowering costs, protecting ecosystems, and improving food security globally.",

      "summary": "Over 80% of the world's flowering plants rely on pollinators to reproduce, and pollinators provide an estimated $200 billion in ecological services annually.\n\nThere are around 20,000 species of bees globally, with over 500 species found in Minnesota alone. Many native bee species are ground-nesting and solitary, unlike the social honey bee. Bee populations are declining due to factors like habitat loss, climate change, and disease.\n\nRestoring pollinator habitat on agricultural landscapes is critical. Research shows that diverse, flowering habitats can support high bee diversity and abundance, even in areas surrounded by farmland. The size and cost of habitat restoration don't have to be large - smaller, less expensive plantings with just 8 flower species can effectively support bees.\n\nPollinator habitats don't increase pest problems in adjacent crop fields, and can actually boost yields of self-pollinating crops like soybeans by up to 20% through improved pollination. Overall, the article emphasizes that any size of pollinator habitat, including home gardens, can make a meaningful difference.\n\nThe article cites research from the University of Minnesota Bee Lab and other sources.

Each system was paired with 3 starter fertilizer strategies: unfertilized control, 15 lb N/ac, and 15 lb N/ac + 10 lb S/ac.\n\nKey findings:\n- Starter fertilizer increased early-season soybean biomass by ~12% but did not affect final yields.\n- Soybean yields ranged from 60-95 bu/ac across locations, with no significant differences between tillage systems. \n- When accounting for operational costs, NT had the highest partial net return, followed by ST and CT. NT+CR had the lowest net return due to cover crop management costs.\n- The project will continue in 2026 to track longer-term soil and soybean responses in the conservation systems.\n\nThe article includes:\n- Locations of trials in Illinois and Iowa\n- Cereal rye management details (40-50 lb/ac, 1000-1200 lb/ac biomass)\n- Soybean planting details (30-in rows, 140,000-150,000 seeds/ac)\n- Figures showing soybean growth, leaf nutrient levels, and yield distributions\n- Table of estimated costs, revenue, and partial net return for each system\n\nOverall, the results suggest that reduced tillage and cereal rye cover crops can maintain soybean yields compared to conventional tillage, although profitability may be impacted by the higher management costs.

      "summary": "This approach originated in Brazil's tropical rainforests and can be a good option for farmers with forested land.\n\nForest farming involves thinning out a forest to create the optimal conditions for growing crops in the understory, such as native ornamentals, fungi, fruit, timber, and forest food crops. It can also involve practices like silvopasture (combining forestry and ranching) and alley cropping (growing crops between rows of trees).\n\nKey benefits of forest farming include:\n- Improved water and soil quality\n- Carbon sequestration (up to 22 lbs per year in first 20 years)\n- Habitat for beneficial insects, birds, mammals, fungi, and bacteria\n- Opportunities to grow specialty crops like mushrooms, ramps, syrups, and edible roots\n\nThe best candidates for forest farming are farms that already have forested areas or riparian zones with trees. It can be done on a small scale to provide cover for sensitive crops. Farmers should consult their agricultural extension office to develop a forest management plan.\n\nThere are also considerations around regulations, especially for wild plants, and the need to be proactive about marketing and selling forest-grown products through avenues like online sales, pick-your-own, and agritourism.",

The disease, which had been endemic in several Latin American countries since 1904, was first detected in the U.S. in 2015 and has since spread to 16 states and Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe research team, led by C.D. Cruz, associate professor of botany and plant pathology at Purdue, is using a mix of statistical analysis, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, artificial intelligence, and computer vision to better understand the dynamics of tar spot in corn. Their work is funded by two USDA grants totaling nearly $1.1 million.\n\nThe researchers are collaborating with colleagues in Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S. to address biosecurity challenges and provide rapid and accurate information to stakeholders. They have developed a digital method for quantifying tar spot in corn, which they have tested under field conditions against human raters.\n\nAnother research effort involves the laboratory of Purdue's Mohammad Jahanshahi, who has adapted his AI and computer-vision approaches from monitoring civil infrastructure to inspecting and analyzing agricultural disease epidemiology. Mariela Fernández-Campos, a PhD student, and Abhishek Subedi, a PhD student in civil engineering, are working on a proof-of-concept data fusion project that integrates drone imagery and weather data to capture crucial details about the tar spot pathosystem.\n\nThe team aims to quantify and model tar spot severity by referencing and integrating imagery with spatial and temporal data, ultimately providing farmers with rapid and accurate information about the disease.",

It is taken up by crops, can leach, and is also removed in harvested products.\n- Optimal potassium levels in soil are 100-200 ppm. Deficient levels can reduce yields, while excess potassium can antagonize other nutrient uptake.\n- Soil testing is recommended to determine potassium needs. Fertilizer application rates should be based on crop removal and soil test results.\n- Cover cropping, manure application, and reducing tillage can help retain potassium in the soil system.\n\nThe publication is available free of charge from the UW Madison Nutrient and Pest Management (NPM) program. Farmers are encouraged to review the resource to better understand the potassium cycle and optimize potassium management for their operations.",
