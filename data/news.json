This lockout has cost the U.S. beef industry an estimated $3.3 billion per year. \n\nUSMEF President and CEO Dan Halstrom stated that regaining access to the Chinese market is a top priority, as China is the world's second-largest beef consumer with 400 million middle-class consumers. In 2021, China imported $11.5 billion worth of beef globally.\n\nUSMEF Chairman Cevin Jones emphasized that reopening China is crucial, as the U.S. could capture a significant share of this lucrative market. He noted that in 2019, before the ban, the U.S. exported $300 million worth of beef to China. \n\nHalstrom reported that USMEF is continuously working with the USDA and U.S. Trade Representative's office to address China's BSE concerns and reopen the market. He is hopeful that the two countries can reach an agreement in 2023.\n\nRegaining access to China would provide a major boost to U.S. beef prices and profitability for American cattle producers. Experts recommend that farmers stay engaged with USMEF and government officials to support these ongoing trade negotiations.",

Farmers are looking to add storage capacity to handle larger crop volumes, take advantage of better prices through delayed selling, and avoid the costs of using commercial elevators. \n\nThe high demand is driven by factors like the increasing size of farm operations, the need to store larger harvests, and the desire to have more control over grain marketing. Even with the current economic slowdown, farmers are willing to make these longer-term investments in on-farm storage.",

The key takeaway is that soybean prices rallied on Friday due to optimism over possible Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans, though the details of any such deals remain unclear.",

      "summary": "Across the country, farms, dairies, processors, and ag businesses are struggling to fill necessary roles like milking cows, harvesting crops, running processing lines, and more. This is not just an issue of wages, as many of these jobs offer steady pay, benefits, and security. The problem is that the domestic pipeline to fill these roles is drying up, with declining enrollment in agricultural programs and a thinning practical workforce.\n\nWithout immigrant labor, many of these agricultural jobs go unfilled. When that happens, farms scale back, change crops, reduce herd sizes, automate where possible, or exit the business altogether. This contraction leads to fewer operations, fewer rural jobs, less domestic production, and higher food costs. \n\nIn 2023, foreign-born workers made up 18.6% of the U.S. civilian labor force, or about 29.9 million people. Removing a large share of these workers would cause a collapse in available labor, leading to production slowdowns, supply shortages, price increases, and entire sectors contracting. This would disproportionately impact industries like construction and agriculture that rely heavily on immigrant labor.\n\nThe labor shortage also has implications for Social Security. As a pay-as-you-go system, Social Security depends on today's workers funding today's retirees. With the workforce shrinking and an aging population, the system becomes structurally dependent on immigration to stay solvent. Fewer workers paying in, while benefit obligations remain, accelerates trust-fund depletion and forces difficult adjustments.\n\nOverall, the article argues that agriculture and the broader economy need legal, reliable pathways for immigrant labor to maintain domestic production, rural economies, and the solvency of systems like Social Security. Relying on \"raising wages\" alone is not a sufficient solution if it leads to reduced output and business contraction.",

      "summary": "Key points:\n\n1. Ethanol had a profound impact on the corn market in the 2000s, changing how corn was priced, traded, and stored. Ethanol became a central pillar of U.S. corn demand.\n\n2. If year-round E15 were to become a reality, it likely wouldn't spark another \"ethanol boom\" like in the 2000s. The existing ethanol infrastructure is already in place, so the impact would be more about expansion and optimization rather than ground-up construction.\n\n3. Year-round E15 is expected to provide better downside protection for corn prices in years of big crops, as the additional ethanol demand could help absorb surplus corn. It could also amplify upside in years of weather scares by tightening ending stocks faster.\n\n4. This means firmer price floors, more volatility around policy headlines, and potentially stronger basis near ethanol plants, but not necessarily a sustained bull market.\n\n5. The author recommends that farmers be flexible and use tools like calls, puts, or re-ownership strategies to capture pricing opportunities, as waiting for perfect clarity on E15 could mean missing out on the best pricing windows.\n\n6. The main lesson is that energy policy will continue to matter for corn, and disciplined marketing will be key to navigating the volatility rather than chasing every headline.",

      "summary": "The Texas A&M University System Board of Regents has voted to rename a center focused on sustainable solutions for agriculture and forestry industries to the Hood Family Center for Greenhouse Gas Management in Agriculture and Forestry. This comes after the John and Sally Hood Family Foundation provided a $5 million endowment to support the center's work, which was launched in 2023 as a joint center of Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Texas A&M University in College Station.\n\nThe center brings together expertise across Texas A&M to advance the abilities of agriculture and forestry systems to meet modern demands for safe, affordable food and fiber production on thriving working lands. It focuses on converging research, teaching, and extension efforts with ongoing research on the sustainability of emerging practices like carbon capture in Texas soils and crops. These unbiased research efforts aim to improve soil health and function, as well as resilience against increasing environmental and biological stressors.\n\nThe director of the center, Nithya Rajan, Ph.D., stated that the generous support from the Hood family is critical to their mission of turning science into producer-ready solutions that strengthen soil health, reduce input costs, and keep working lands productive for generations. John Hood, who graduated from Texas A&M in 1990, and his wife, Sally, who graduated in 1992, said they were impressed with the center's work and felt it was an opportunity to make a difference for their children and grandchildren.",

      "summary": "Oak wilt is one of the most destructive tree diseases in the U.S., killing millions of trees across Central Texas.\n\nThe agency is providing up to $5,000 for installing trenches to contain the disease and up to $2,000 for removing infected red oak trees. This funding is critical as the high-risk spring season begins, when sap-feeding beetles that spread the fungal spores are most active.\n\nThe Texas Oak Wilt Cost Share program is designed to empower landowners to take proactive measures before the disease can further devastate local tree canopies and diminish property values. Landowners must work with Texas A&M Forest Service staff to verify the disease and develop a management plan before accessing the cost-share funds.\n\nThe agency emphasizes that the health of oak trees is vital to the Central Texas landscape and economy, as private landowners own 95% of the state's forests. This funding allows the Forest Service to shift from reactive to more proactive management of the oak wilt outbreak.\n\nLandowners are also reminded to avoid pruning oak trees from February 1 to June 30 to prevent attracting the disease-spreading beetles. If pruning is necessary, all wounds must be painted immediately.\n\nThe Texas A&M Forest Service has regional offices across Central Texas to provide technical assistance to landowners concerned about oak wilt on their property. Interested landowners can use the \"Find My Forester\" tool to connect with their county representative.",

There is no cost to attend, and pre-registration is not required.\n\nThe comprehensive curriculum includes five sessions over two days, covering topics such as a deep dive into the 4Rs of nutrient management, adapting N management to climate, reducing nitrate loss to water, emerging biological nitrogen products, and utilizing variable rate technology for N applications. Certified Crop Advisors (CCAs) can earn a total of 5 Nutrient Management and 6 Soil and Water credits by attending all sessions.\n\nThe events are driven by high fertilizer prices, recent low commodity prices, and ongoing environmental concerns, which have created a complex landscape for producers when making fertility decisions. The Nitrogen College workshops aim to help farmers address these challenges and improve their N management strategies.\n\nDetailed schedules and additional information for the Hutchinson and Mankato events are available on the University of Minnesota Extension website. Participants should note that lunch will not be provided, and they should plan accordingly.\n\nFor more information or to ask questions, attendees can contact Brad Carlson, Extension educator, at bcarlson@umn.edu.

The true indicator of content effectiveness is now attention time - how long a user spends meaningfully engaged with the content.\n\nAgWeb.com, a Farm Journal website, recently underwent a redesign to increase user engagement and attention time:\n- 54% increase in readers reaching 75% of an article\n- 21% increase in readers reaching 90% of an article\n- 33% increase in daily article pageviews per mobile user\n\nThe article cites that in general, only 16% of users read every word of online content, while 79% scan pages rather than reading fully. AgWeb's redesign aimed to simplify layouts and guide deeper engagement.\n\nAttention time is a clearer indicator of impact than click-through rate, as it shows if users stayed with the content, scrolled with purpose, consumed multiple articles, and were in an active, focused mindset. High-attention environments deliver stronger results for advertisers, as their brand is present during engaged moments.\n\nThe improvements on AgWeb translate to more value for brands, providing more time with content, increased exposure opportunities, and higher quality impressions. This aligns with how farmers search and consume content today. For ag marketers, AgWeb's optimized content and design offers one of the most effective digital environments, as better attention leads to better outcomes.",

Soybean futures rallied more than 3% to a two-month high on the news.\n\nThe call also covered trade and security tensions between the world's two largest economies. China warned the U.S. about arms sales to Taiwan, which China considers its own territory. The U.S. recently announced an $11.1 billion arms deal with Taiwan, its largest ever.\n\nOther issues discussed included Iran, the Russia-Ukraine war, airplane engines, and oil and gas. China is a major buyer of Venezuelan oil, which has helped Caracas repay loans to Beijing.\n\nExperts say both sides are signaling a desire to preserve stability in the U.S.-China relationship, despite ongoing areas of tension. Trump has eased some policies toward China in recent months, from tariffs to advanced technology exports.\n\nHowever, a Democratic U.S. Representative criticized Trump's focus on soybean purchases, saying it ignores China's \"aggression towards Taiwan, support for Putin's invasion of Ukraine or human rights abuses.\"\n\nU.S. soybean supplies may not be sufficient to meet an additional 8 million tons of Chinese demand, potentially leading to higher prices and more Brazilian soybean purchases, according to an agricultural economist.",

Each system was paired with 3 starter fertilizer strategies: unfertilized control, 15 lb N/ac, and 15 lb N/ac + 10 lb S/ac.\n\nEarly soybean growth showed a response to starter fertilizer, with 12% higher biomass at the V4 stage. However, by the R2 stage, leaf tissue N and S levels were sufficient across all treatments, indicating the soybeans could meet their nutrient needs through biological fixation and soil organic matter. \n\nSoybean yields ranged from 60-95 bu/ac across the sites. Starter fertilizer did not significantly increase yields. Yields were similar across tillage systems, with CT/ST averaging 78.4 bu/ac, NT 77.6 bu/ac, and NT+CR 76.2 bu/ac.\n\nWhen factoring in costs, NT had the highest partial net return, followed by ST and CT. NT+CR had the lowest partial net return due to higher cover crop management costs of $55/ac, though this can be offset by conservation program cost-share.\n\nThe trials will continue in 2026 to track medium-term effects on soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics in these conservation systems. This will provide valuable insights to help farmers adopt conservation practices without sacrificing yield.",

The state saw record corn yields of over 200 bushels per acre in 2025.\n\n- However, cost of production has risen significantly in recent years, with the average Minnesota farmer spending $4.71, $11.02, and $6.26 per bushel to produce corn, soybeans, and spring wheat in 2024 - exceeding current cash prices. \n\n- Median net farm income in Minnesota dropped to $2,400 in 2024, the lowest in 25 years, as profit margins tightened across the state.\n\n- In response, the federal government launched the $11 billion Farmer Bridge Assistance program in 2025 to provide payments to farmers of up to 35% of expected 2025 crop losses.\n\n- The 2026 Farm Bill will see changes, including raising the payment limit to $155,000 per person, increasing ARC revenue guarantees, and adding up to 30 million new base acres nationally.\n\n- At the national level, 2025 saw record corn production of 17 million bushels, with high ending stocks and strong export demand projected to keep corn prices stable going forward.\n\n- Crop analysts predict a reversal in 2026 with decreased corn acreage and increased soybean acreage compared to 2025.",

Good crops to grow in a greenhouse in February include tomatoes, peppers, brassicas (kale, cabbage, cauliflower), lettuces, potatoes, onions, and various flowers.\n\n4. Greenhouse growing helps provide a head start on the growing season, protects plants from pests and diseases, and allows for growing cool-weather crops like brassicas and lettuces even in frost-free areas.\n\n5. Key factors to consider are maintaining consistent warmth (50°F or higher), moisture, and light for optimal growth of seedlings and transplants.\n\n6.

This included direct payments of up to $100,000 per farmer to help offset increased input costs.\n\nThe Renewable Fuels Association reported that ethanol production reached an all-time high of 17 billion gallons in 2025, up 8% from the previous year. This was driven by the Biden administration's push for greater biofuel blending.\n\nLooking ahead, the USDA is projecting corn and soybean yields to rebound in 2026, with corn yields forecast at 180 bushels per acre and soybean yields at 50 bushels per acre. This is expected to help ease pressure on commodity prices.\n\nFarmers are encouraged to review risk management strategies such as crop insurance and forward contracting to protect against price volatility in the year ahead.",

Milk cow inventories reached 9.57 million head in late 2025 - the highest since 1993. However, replacement heifer numbers fell to 3.91 million head - the lowest since 1978.\n\n2. Culling has remained low, keeping older cows in production longer and inflating short-term milk supplies. This has boosted output but weakened the biological pipeline needed to sustain production over time.\n\n3. A key driver is beef-on-dairy economics. Strong beef prices and premiums for beef-on-dairy calves have encouraged producers to shift breeding toward beef genetics, improving cash flow but reducing dairy-bred heifers entering the replacement pool.\n\n4. Expanding milk production globally has weighed on farm-level prices, though record butter and cheese exports have provided some relief. Milk pricing is no longer the primary signal guiding herd decisions.\n\n5. The concern is that with supply sustained by aging cows and a thinning replacement pipeline, future supply adjustments could be faster and more volatile when they occur.\n\nTakeaway for Farmers: Record milk output looks strong today, but shrinking replacement numbers mean future supply adjustments could be sharper than in past cycles.",

Plant prairie strips - Devoting 10-25% of farmland to prairie strips can boost yields, improve soil nutrients, and attract beneficial predators and pollinators. The diverse plants and flowers support a healthy above and below-ground ecosystem.\n\n2. Reduce tilling and use cover crops - Minimizing tillage and planting cover crops instead improves soil structure and increases insect biodiversity. This supports more animal species on the land.\n\n3. Practice regenerative grazing - Using a rotational grazing model and planting native grasses/forbs instead of non-native forage can boost biodiversity in grazing areas, especially when combined with techniques like prescribed burning and silvopasture.\n\n4. Implement Integrated Pest Management (IPM) - Attracting beneficial insects through diverse plantings and cultural pest control methods reduces the need for harmful pesticides that damage biodiversity.\n\n5. Establish conservation easements - Partnering with land trusts to protect farmland can provide more habitat for local species while also offering tax benefits to landowners.\n\nAdopting these strategies, even partially, can help farmers work in harmony with the natural world around them, supporting species diversity and overall farm health. Experts emphasize that these practices, while sometimes requiring more effort upfront, ultimately lead to more sustainable and productive agricultural systems.",

It has applications across farming - as livestock feed, renewable energy, and protein-rich food source, especially in Japan.\n\nHowever, there are challenges in mass-producing this alga. Since the 1990s, scientists have been working to scale up production.\n\nChlorella vulgaris is a microalga that replicates easily in optimal conditions. It is autotrophic, using CO2 and inorganic nitrogen as a source for glucose. This makes it a sustainable solution for food security.\n\nThe alga is a rich source of nutrients and protein. It can also act as a bioremediant, absorbing heavy metals. Recent studies show it's a good candidate for renewable biofuel production.\n\nKey obstacles in scaling up production include lack of proposed cleanup methods, and difficulties in developing small-scale production methods (most current methods are large-scale).\n\nPotential solutions include using geothermal energy from natural hot springs to cultivate the alga at its ideal 77°F temperature. However, this can impact its nutrient content. Trials are also underway to explore other microalgae species with similar benefits.\n\nOverall, with further research and development, Chlorella vulgaris has high potential to become a widely-adopted superfood with minimal environmental impact.",

Cruz, are using a mix of statistical, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, AI, and computer vision methods to better understand the dynamics of tar spot in corn. Their work is funded by two USDA grants totaling nearly $1.1 million.\n\n- In previous efforts, the researchers developed a digital method (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn, which they tested against human raters. They are now refining the training methods to improve the model's accuracy.\n\n- The research team also includes Purdue's Mohammad Jahanshahi, who has adapted his AI and computer-vision approaches to inspecting and analyzing civil infrastructure damage for agriculture.\n\n- Graduate students Mariela Fernández-Campos and Abhishek Subedi are finalizing a proof-of-concept data fusion project, integrating drone imagery and weather data to capture details about the tar spot pathosystem.\n\n- Another parallel task is to quantify and model tar spot epidemics in production-style fields, using disease observations and drone-based imagery.\n\n- The interdisciplinary approach aims to quantify and model tar spot severity by referencing and integrating imagery with spatial and temporal data.",
