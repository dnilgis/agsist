Analyze input costs: Fertilizer prices are up 80-100% from 2021, while diesel fuel is 40-50% higher. Farmers should review all input costs and seek ways to optimize usage.\n\n2. Diversify crop selection: Consider planting a mix of crops to spread risk. For example, planting both corn and soybeans can help offset price swings in a single commodity.\n\n3. Utilize crop insurance: Enroll in federal crop insurance programs to protect against yield and revenue losses. Coverage levels of 80-85% are recommended.\n\n4. Implement precision agriculture: Use data-driven tools like variable-rate application to optimize input use and maximize returns per acre.\n\n5. Explore alternative markets: Investigate selling directly to end-users or niche markets to capture higher prices and offset input cost increases.\n\n6. Communicate with lenders: Work closely with banks and lending institutions to secure adequate financing and credit lines for the upcoming season.\n\nThe article stresses that flexibility, planning, and risk mitigation will be critical for farmers to navigate the challenging economic environment and protect their bottom line in 2023.",

      "summary": "Bijesh Maharjan, an associate professor and extension specialist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) Panhandle Research, Extension, and Education Center, has been named the inaugural Ray and Jolene Ward Professor of Soil Health Science. This new professorship, effective April 1, 2026, honors the Wards for their longstanding contributions to Nebraska agriculture through their company, Ward Laboratories, Inc.\n\nRay Ward founded Ward Laboratories in 1983 and has been a tireless advocate for sustainable soil management practices that enhance soil health, conserve resources, and improve long-term productivity. He has received numerous honors, including from the Soil Science Society of America, Nebraska Farm Bureau, and Nebraska Hall of Agricultural Achievement.\n\nAs the first recipient of the professorship, Dr. Maharjan has focused his work on soil health, proposing the concepts of the \"Soil Health Gap\" and the \"Soil Health Cycle.\" The Soil Health Gap framework allows for comparing cropland soil health to a native reference site, while the Soil Health Cycle integrates human dimensions, management practices, soil health indicators, and ecosystem service outcomes.\n\nDr. Maharjan's extension efforts have led to the establishment of the Nebraska Soil Health School, which brings together NRCS experts, university scientists, and producer-leaders for hands-on events across the state. Participants have consistently praised the quality of the learning opportunities, which combine demonstrations and evidence-based discussions.",

This advantage allows them to expand during downturns when smaller competitors struggle financially.\n- The growing concentration of farmland under larger operations is changing how agribusiness firms structure services and risk management offerings, as grain merchandising, input purchasing, and contract negotiations increasingly involve fewer but larger producers.\n- While productivity gains often follow scale, the concentration raises ongoing debate about market access and competition across rural regions.\n\nThe key takeaway for farmers is that scale is becoming increasingly important for competitiveness in modern crop production.",

This overturns the tariffs Trump implemented on Chinese imports from 2018-2022, which ranged from 10-25%. \n\nAccording to expert Jim DeLisi, this Supreme Court decision means the U.S. government must refund over $60 billion in tariffs collected from importers during that period. Farmers and other businesses that paid these tariffs on Chinese goods can now seek refunds.\n\nDeLisi stated that the ruling sets an important precedent, limiting the President's ability to unilaterally impose tariffs in the future without Congressional approval. He recommends affected farmers and businesses monitor developments and consult legal counsel to understand their options for seeking tariff refunds.\n\nThe decision comes after years of legal challenges to Trump's use of IEEPA, which was intended for emergency national security situations, not trade disputes. The Supreme Court has now firmly rejected this application of presidential tariff authority.",

Experts state that one would have to consume nearly 20,000 slices of bread per day at the highest levels found (191 ppb) to exceed the EPA's safety benchmarks. The article emphasizes that the federal government already conducts comprehensive pesticide monitoring, and over 97% of domestic food samples were below EPA tolerance levels with no dangerous residues detected.\n\nThe article suggests that this initiative by the Florida government is a political stunt, aimed at boosting Governor DeSantis' political prowess by appealing to the \"Make America Healthy Again\" (MAHA) movement, which has gained prominence in Republican politics. It argues that the real danger lies in elevating fringe groups and their anti-science rhetoric to the mainstream, rather than the actual levels of glyphosate found in the bread.\n\nOverall, the article concludes that the Healthy Florida First initiative is not addressing a legitimate food safety issue, but rather using it as a political strategy, and that the long-term effects of this approach could be more damaging than the trace amounts of glyphosate in the food supply.",

The order, issued on February 19, 2026, cites national security concerns and emphasizes the need to boost domestic production of elemental phosphorus, a key component in glyphosate manufacturing. \n\nThe order aims to reduce the U.S. reliance on imported glyphosate and phosphorus.

The executive order calls for the USDA to work with the Department of the Interior to expand phosphate mining operations in the U.S. and streamline the permitting process. \n\nThis move is expected to have significant impacts on farmers and the agricultural industry. Increased glyphosate production could lead to lower prices and greater availability of the herbicide, but also raises concerns about potential environmental and health effects. Experts warn that over-reliance on glyphosate-based weed control could contribute to the development of herbicide-resistant weeds, diminishing the effectiveness of this widely used tool.\n\nThe order does not provide specific timelines or production targets, but directs the USDA to work with relevant federal agencies to develop a plan to boost domestic glyphosate and phosphorus supplies within 6 months.",

However, Blue cautions that this is not true spring, and the warm weather can lead to issues like sunburns.\n\nThe article provides the following key details:\n\n- This year's false spring started in January and continued into February, with people wearing t-shirts on Valentine's Day.\n- Blue heard a flock of robins and saw a flock of geese, signs that typically indicate the arrival of spring.\n- Blue's daughter was excited to pull out next summer's clothes, but Blue made her come back inside to avoid sunburn.\n- Blue herself got a sunburn on her chin from the unexpected warmth.\n- The false spring is expected to end soon, with the author only having a fading tan and peeling chin as evidence of the brief warm period.\n\nThe article highlights the disconnect between the physical sensations of warmth and the reality that true spring has not yet arrived. It serves as a cautionary tale for farmers and residents of the Northern Plains about the risks of false spring, such as sunburns and being caught off-guard by the return of winter weather.",

As small business owners, they strive to provide good-paying jobs and give back to their community.\n\nIn 2021, 13 states implemented new SNAP restrictions, including banning the use of SNAP benefits to purchase hot foods and prepared meals. This has created confusion among SNAP recipients, who are unsure of what they can and cannot buy. Some small businesses that previously accepted SNAP payments have had to stop, leading to \"more chaos\" for their customers.\n\nThe new SNAP restrictions aim to limit the use of benefits for less healthy food options. However, this is causing hardship for low-income families and small businesses that rely on SNAP transactions. There are concerns that these changes will make it more difficult for SNAP recipients to access affordable, nutritious food.\n\nExperts emphasize the need for clear, consistent communication from state agencies to help SNAP recipients understand the new rules. Small business owners also call for more flexibility and support to continue serving their SNAP-reliant customers.",

Treatments differed by presence/absence of a pH-lowering adjuvant (AlpHa Shot) and timing of spray solution mixing (6 days prior or at time of spraying).\n\n- Adding the pH-lowering adjuvant reduced spray water pH from 7.5 to 5.8, improving waterhemp control by 10% at 24 days after treatment (DAT) and 7% at 112 DAT.\n\n- Waterhemp density decreased by 64% and biomass reduced by 55% with the pH-adjusting adjuvant, resulting in lower late-season weed pressure and seed production.\n\n- Timing of mixing the pH adjuster (6 days ahead or at spraying) did not affect waterhemp control, density or biomass.\n\n- The response to pH adjustment was seen at both full and half rates of Acuron GT, indicating water quality can influence herbicide performance regardless of rate.\n\n- Adjusting and buffering spray water pH is a simple step that can protect herbicide performance and improve season-long weed management when water makes up most of the spray tank.",

Needs soil temp of at least 40°F to germinate.\n\n- Kale - A multipurpose cover crop that feeds the soil, you, customers, and livestock. Kale needs slightly warmer soil of 45°F. Opt for disease-resistant varieties if issues are common.  \n\n- Daikon radish - Also called forage radish, the deep taproots can break up compacted soil and scavenge leftover nitrogen. Requires soil of at least 65°F to sow.\n\n- Oats - Grow quickly to cover soil and prevent weed germination. Form beneficial relationships with fungi. Sow at 4-6 oz per 100 sq ft, can terminate without harvesting.\n\n- Buckwheat - A quick-growing \"phosphorus scavenger\" that conditions poor soils. Attracts pollinators and can be used as an organic mulch.\n\nPlanting cover crops in February offers benefits like improved soil health, carbon sequestration, erosion prevention, and potential yield increases for subsequent cash crops. Farmers should consider their local climate and soil conditions when selecting the best options.",

      "summary": "This can be a cost-effective way to revitalize a diminishing stand or introduce legumes.\n\nTiming is critical - frost seeding is typically done between mid-February and early March to coincide with the freeze-thaw cycle, which helps incorporate the seed into the soil. Seed should be applied to bare soil, not snow-covered ground.\n\nThe condition of the existing stand is also important. A thick thatch can hinder seed-to-soil contact, so it's recommended to closely graze or hay the area in the fall/winter before seeding. Bare spots are a good indicator that frost seeding may work well.\n\nSoil type matters - frost seeding tends to be more successful on loam or clay soils that expand/contract during freeze-thaw, rather than sandy soils. Avoiding soil compaction by seeding when the ground is frozen is also important.\n\nAdequate spring moisture is vital for establishing a healthy frost-seeded stand. While the potential benefits are high, timing, soil conditions, and moisture all play crucial roles in the success of frost seeding.\n\nThe article was authored by Dr. Shelby Gruss, an assistant professor and forage extension specialist at Iowa State University who joined the department in November 2023.

Low tunnels and cold frames are simpler options that can raise temperatures 2-15 degrees. Larger, fortified greenhouses with climate controls allow for year-round growing.\n\nKey crops to grow in February greenhouses include:\n- Tomatoes and peppers, which benefit from the early start and consistent warmth and moisture\n- Brassicas like kale, cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli rabe, which can be protected from pests\n- Lettuces, which can be grown earlier for spring markets\n- Potatoes, to get a head start on full-sized or baby potatoes\n- Onions, including sets, seeds, and bunching onions\n- Flowers like lisianthus, coneflowers, and dahlias that take a long time to sprout\n\nThe article notes the importance of understanding the specific capabilities of your greenhouse setup to choose the best crops to grow. It advises using seed trays, heating mats, automatic lighting, and proper ventilation and climate control as needed.",
