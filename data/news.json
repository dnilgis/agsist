This blend was available on the market.\n    - Blend 2: Mix of all B vitamins, along with higher levels of vitamins A, D3 and E, and fermentation extracts. Jefo is developing this blend.\n\n- Key findings:\n    - Calves that received the on-the-market vitamin blend had a 42% delay in the need for medical treatment and required fewer treatments if they did get sick.\n    - The group that received the vitamin blend under development had a 14% reduction in required medical treatment compared to control groups but did not show any difference in treatment timing.\n    - The majority of benefits were observed in the first 28 days, suggesting that early vitamin supplementation is key to improving calves' health following a stressful event.\n\n- The research highlights the need for strategic nutritional supplementation when cattle's rumen is not able to produce essential nutrients due to stress, in order to support their continued good health.\n\n- Hirano would like to continue studying the effects of B vitamins on animal health, exploring the nutritional impacts of different B vitamins and their potential relation to inflammation.",

They found farmers appear more willing than able to seek help.\n\n- Recommendations:\n1) Focus on removing barriers to access rather than just encouraging farmers to seek help\n2) Integrate financial and mental health support, as they are deeply connected for farmers\n3) Provide resources to help farmers navigate complex paperwork and access programs\n\n- Expert quote from researcher Florence Becot: \"Instead of asking, 'how do we convince farmers to seek help,' the focus should be on how we can remove barriers that prevent farmers from accessing help when they want it.\"",

      "summary": "Farmers are now using AI tools, voice search, and quick-scan platforms that often provide answers without requiring a click. The true indicator of content effectiveness is now attention time - how long a user spends meaningfully engaged with the content. \n\nThe article looks at recent updates to AgWeb.com that were designed to increase user attention and engagement:\n- 54% increase in readers reaching 75% of an article\n- 21% increase in readers reaching 90% of an article\n- 33% increase in mobile users reading more articles per visit\n\nThese deeper scroll patterns and increased article consumption indicate higher user engagement and attention. The article notes that in general, only 16% of users read content word-for-word, while 79% scan pages, absorbing at most 28% of the text.\n\nThe article explains why attention time is more valuable for advertisers than click-through rate. Attention time measures if users stayed, scrolled with purpose, and consumed multiple articles - behaviors that directly influence brand recall, message retention, and ad effectiveness.\n\nThe improvements on AgWeb are said to translate into more value for brands, with ads appearing in high-attention environments where farmers linger, not just skim. This allows for more quality impressions and better alignment with how farmers search today.\n\nThe article concludes that AgWeb's focus on attention vs. clicks offers one of the most effective digital environments for ag marketers looking to reach farmers in focused, engaged moments.",

      "summary": "This disturbance will require mitigation and renovation, often at inconvenient times for farmers.\n\nKey points:\n- Pipeline easements/ROWs can impact farms year-round, with the pipeline company focused on their timeline and erosion control, while farmers have additional concerns like crops, weeds, soil compaction, and timing.\n- When reseeding ROWs, farmers should consider what their livestock is accustomed to grazing and the equipment they have available. Warm-season perennials may not work well for a July reseeding, but summer annuals like sudangrass, sorghum-sudangrass, pearl millet, and teff grass can be good options.\n- For August/September reseedings, oats, triticale, and annual ryegrass are recommended to graze or harvest in the spring.\n- Grasses and legumes each provide different benefits - grasses reduce erosion while legumes add nitrogen and can increase carrying capacity, but must be balanced to avoid issues like grass tetany or bloat.\n- Key preparation steps include soil testing/amendments, weed control, using high-quality seed, inoculating legumes, suppressing existing vegetation, calibrating equipment, and planting the best crop for the timing.\n- Farmers should leverage resources and have conversations to develop a thorough plan for dealing with unscheduled pipeline easement work.",

They grew large during the 19th century when extensive land clearing occurred for agriculture and development.\n\n- Wolf trees were often spared and left standing to provide shade for livestock or produce mast crops like nuts and seeds. Without competition, they developed massive, spreading canopies.\n\n- As farms were abandoned in the late 19th century, new forests grew up around the wolf trees. Now shaded by younger trees, the wolf trees are declining but remain ecologically important.\n\n- Wolf trees provide shelter, food, and nesting sites for a wide variety of wildlife species, even after death when their rotting wood and cavities continue to support diverse organisms.\n\n- While lacking commercial timber value, wolf trees are historically and ecologically significant, offering insights into a region's agricultural past.\n\nNumbers/Statistics:\n- Up to 80% of land in the northeast US was cleared during the 19th century for agriculture and development.\n\nDates/Deadlines: \n- Wolf trees grew to maturity during the early-to-mid 19th century when land clearing was widespread.\n- Many wolf trees are now nearly 200 years old.\n\nNames:\n- No specific individuals or organizations mentioned.\n\nLocations:\n- Northeastern United States\n\nContext/Causes:\n- European settlement and land clearing for agriculture and development in the 19th century led to the emergence of isolated \"wolf trees\".\n- Subsequent farmland abandonment allowed new forests to grow around the wolf trees.\n\nImpacts for Farmers:\n- Wolf trees provided valuable shade and mast crops for livestock when farms were active.\n\nRecommendations/Actions:\n- None specified, but the article emphasizes the ecological and historical value of preserving wolf trees.\n\nExpert Quotes:\n- None provided.",

Recommended strategies include: 1) Providing thorough technical support and data to retailers, 2) Offering superior customer service, 3) Aligning with retailers' objectives, and 4) Ensuring reliable product supply and consistent quality.\n\nRetailers want biological companies to clearly communicate product benefits, performance data, and return on investment for farmers. Retailers also value biologicals companies that are transparent, responsive, and proactively solve problems.\n\nBuilding strong relationships is crucial, as retailers control 85-90% of the biologicals market access point for farmers. Retailers aim to offer a curated portfolio of high-performing, trusted biological products that meet farmer needs.\n\nThe article cites ARA President and CEO Daren Coppock, who emphasizes the importance of building retailer confidence through technical expertise, customer service, and reliable supply. Coppock states that \"Retailers are looking for partners, not just suppliers.\"",

      "summary": "S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in July 2025 is a major concern for Canada's consul general, as trade predictability is crucial for Minnesota's agricultural industry. Beth Richardson, Canada's consul general in Minneapolis, stated that if the USMCA is renewed for 16 more years, it would provide the much-needed predictability for businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nThe three countries combined account for around $1.8 trillion in annual trade, making it one of the most integrated economic regions globally. Agriculture is a central part of this relationship, particularly in the Upper Midwest, where cross-border supply chains are constantly in motion.\n\nAndrea Vaubel, the deputy commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, emphasized the importance of stability, noting the state's position as a major producer of livestock, grain, and specialty crops. Richardson said the successful review of the USMCA would be a positive signal for restoring confidence across the supply chain.\n\nThe article also highlighted the impact of tariff uncertainty, such as the briefly imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports of steel and aluminum last February, which affected the affordability of potash, a critical fertilizer for farmers. Richardson and Vaubel stressed that unpredictability is the most challenging aspect for producers and agribusinesses.\n\nAlejandra Bologna, the head consul of Mexico in St. Paul, stated that 85% of the goods traded between Mexico and the U.S. are under the USMCA treatment and are not affected by tariffs. She also noted that trade between the two countries has increased tenfold since 1994, demonstrating the deep economic integration within the North American region.\n\nThe article provided examples of the integration, such as Canada supplying over 90% of the oats used by U.S. food processing facilities, and the U.S. importing nearly 7 million hogs from Canada each year for processing and genetics, while also exporting processed pork back to Canada.\n\nOverall, the key takeaways are the importance of trade predictability, the need to avoid tariff uncertainty, the deep economic integration within the North American region, and the mutually dependent agricultural relationship between Canada and Minnesota.",

However, Texas producers held back 50,000 more heifers, an 8% increase in replacements that could indicate the early stages of a gradual herd rebuild.\n\nNationally, beef cow numbers dropped just over 1%, a sharper decline than expected. Experts anticipate a slower cattle herd rebuild and tighter cattle supplies will continue to impact the industry from cow-calf operations to feedlots, packers, and grocery stores. \n\nHigh calf prices and concerns over a rapid herd rebuild and subsequent price drops are causing some ranchers to prioritize short-term returns by selling bred heifers rather than holding them back for herd growth. Bred heifer values have reached $4,000-$5,000.\n\nTexas' long-term cattle capacity has also been impacted by urban expansion, land fragmentation, and conversion of pasture to non-agricultural uses. Emerging drought is another factor that could influence producer decisions.\n\nExperts expect calf prices could climb even higher in 2026-2027 due to the tightened supplies, with 500-600 lb steers currently averaging $450/cwt in Texas compared to $326/cwt last year. Cow-calf producer margins should remain strong, supported by lower feed costs and sustained demand.\n\nHowever, the outlook for Texas will depend heavily on how the drought situation evolves in the state. Recent winter storms brought snow, ice, and freezing temperatures, causing challenges for livestock producers with some calf losses reported. Wheat and oat crops were also impacted.",

      "summary": "Amid a dim outlook for corn and soybean price improvements, some positive news emerged regarding the 45z tax credit.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations for domestic producers of clean transportation fuel to determine their eligibility for and calculate the clean fuel production credit. This news was welcomed by the biofuels and soybean industry.\n\nThe 45Z program, created under President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and amended last year under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, gives soybean oil a better standing with a higher credit, going from 30 cents per gallon to 60 cents per gallon.\n\nTom Verry, the director of outreach and development for Clean Fuels Alliance America, stated that the guidance will kickstart an industry that has been in a state of limbo for the last year. The tax credit is projected to result in a record use of 15.5 billion pounds of soybean oil in biofuels this year, more than half of U.S. production.\n\nScott Metzger, the American Soybean Association (ASA) President and Ohio farmer, expressed excitement about the credit news, stating that it will help build domestic markets for U.S. soybeans. Steve Censky, the ASA CEO, also noted that the credit news should be paired with finalizing the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) blending targets to complement the work of the Treasury and Congress.\n\nThe clean fuel production credit provides businesses an income tax credit for clean transportation fuel produced domestically after December 31, 2024, and sold by December 31, 2029. The guidance also proposes rules to implement certain changes to the credit brought on by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",

This was part of a pilot project with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.\n\nThe Blairs' system stores water in a pond and pumps it through an irrigation pivot on 125 acres. While recent rains have limited their ability to test the full impact, Iowa State data has shown yield increases from the system. Experts like Chris Hay of Hay Water Solutions say the system can provide a 3-inch supplemental water supply during dry summer periods.\n\nAn economic analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund found drainage water recycling can boost crop yield income by $130-$146 per acre annually, while saving $10-$20 per acre in operating costs. The practice also provides water quality benefits by reducing nutrient runoff.\n\nHowever, these systems require a significant upfront investment of $2-$3 million, plus ongoing maintenance. Experts recommend having a pond that can store 4-6 inches of water for the irrigated area. Funding will likely require both private farmer investment and public/outside support.\n\nThe Blairs advise other farmers interested in this to seek local help and expertise to plan and implement the system. They are now looking to add features like a fertilizer injection system to further optimize the setup.",

This led her to pivot and pursue a career in nursing.\n\n- After graduating from Texas A&M, Heck earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through the accelerated BSN program at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio, completing it in 15 months.\n\n- Heck credits her nutrition degree from Texas A&M for providing her with a strong science background that helped her succeed in nursing school and become a strong nurse.\n\n- Heck is now a Registered Nurse Certified in Maternal Newborn Nursing at Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, one of the largest hospitals in Texas. She plans to apply to graduate school to become a women's health nurse practitioner.\n\n- The article highlights how Heck's science-based nutrition foundation and willingness to pivot shaped her path to a career in maternal newborn nursing, allowing her to combine her interests in nutrition and women's health.",
