      "summary": "With 14.5 million viewers tuning in on streaming platforms alone, food has become a key part of the game day experience. \n\nHome kitchens are taking over game day food preparation, as high stadium concession prices push fans to recreate favorites at home for a fraction of the cost. Hosting at home allows for more control over ingredients, portions, and timing. Handheld and shareable foods like wings, sliders, dips, and desserts are staples of home game day spreads.\n\nIn 2025, the Sunday night NFL championship game averaged 127.7 million viewers, up 3% from 2024 and setting a new record. About 121.1 million Americans expect to host or attend a watch party this year, with total game day-related spending projected to hit $20.2 billion, or $94.77 per person.\n\nThe kitchen has become the \"busiest spot in the house\" on game day, as home cooks cater to viewing crowds without the hassle and high prices of stadium concessions. Experts note that this trend is driven less by necessity and more by the flexibility and control that home cooking provides over the stadium experience.",

Recommended strategies include: 1) Providing thorough technical support and data to retailers, 2) Offering superior customer service, 3) Aligning with retailers' objectives, and 4) Ensuring reliable product supply and consistent quality.\n\nRetailers want biological companies to clearly communicate product benefits, performance data, and return on investment for farmers. Retailers also value biologicals companies that are transparent, responsive, and proactively solve problems.\n\nBuilding strong relationships is crucial, as retailers control 85-90% of the biologicals market access point for farmers. Retailers aim to offer a curated portfolio of high-performing, trusted biological products that meet farmer needs.\n\nThe article cites ARA President and CEO Daren Coppock, who emphasizes the importance of building retailer confidence through technical expertise, customer service, and reliable supply. Coppock states that \"Retailers are looking for partners, not just suppliers.\"",

      "summary": "S. agriculture industry. Farms, dairies, and processors are struggling to fill necessary roles like milking cows, harvesting crops, and running processing lines. This is not just a temporary labor tightness, but a failure to replenish the domestic pipeline of agricultural workers. Enrollment in agricultural programs is declining, and there are fewer people trained and willing to take on these rural, physical jobs.\n\nThe article notes this is not simply a wage issue, as many of these jobs offer steady pay, benefits, and security. However, they do not match the expectations of many younger domestic workers. Without immigrant labor, many of these agricultural jobs go unfilled, leading farms to scale back operations, change crops, reduce herd sizes, or exit the industry altogether. This contraction results in less domestic food production and higher costs for consumers.\n\nThe article argues that what agriculture needs is a legal, reliable, and well-managed immigrant workforce that can be planned around and retained. In 2023, foreign-born workers made up 18.6% of the civilian labor force, or 29.9 million people employed, who paid $651.9 billion in U.S. taxes. Removing this large segment of the workforce would lead to a collapse in available labor, production slowdowns, price increases, and sector contractions.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on agriculture, the article also discusses the implications for Social Security. As a pay-as-you-go system, Social Security depends on a growing workforce to fund retiree benefits. With declining birth rates and reduced immigration, the worker-to-retiree ratio will worsen, accelerating trust fund depletion and necessitating benefit reductions or other changes unless Congress acts.\n\nThe article concludes that immigration is not just a labor issue, but a retirement, fiscal, and food security issue. Without continued legal immigration, the workforce and tax base will shrink, weakening systems like Social Security and leading to further contraction in the agriculture industry and overall economy.",

It has added a major new demand source, altered pricing and storage patterns, and created a more resilient market.\n\n2. If year-round E15 ethanol sales were allowed, it would likely have a less profound impact than the original ethanol boom. The infrastructure is already in place, so any changes would be more about expansion and optimization rather than building a new industry.\n\n3. Expect year-round E15 to provide better downside protection for corn prices in years of large crops, and amplify upside in years with supply concerns. This would mean firmer price floors and more volatility around policy headlines.\n\n4. Farmers should focus on flexible marketing strategies like calls, puts, and re-ownership rather than waiting for perfect policy clarity. Disciplined marketing will be key in this headline-driven market.\n\n5. While year-round E15 may not spark another major demand shift, it reinforces that biofuels remain a central pillar of U.S. corn demand that can expand rather than just shuffle existing use.\n\n6. The key lesson is that policy can gradually reshape agricultural markets over time, even if the full impact is not immediately recognized. Respecting this trend is more important than chasing every headline.",

The system integrates with Vytelle's SENSE feed intake nodes, allowing farmers to measure enteric emissions alongside feed efficiency.\n\nThe system uses a reticulorumen bolus to continuously monitor methane emissions from individual animals. It provides real-time data on methane production, feed intake, and feed efficiency. This enables farmers to identify and select low-methane emitting animals to improve the environmental sustainability of their herd.\n\nAccording to Vytelle, the system costs $350 per animal, which is significantly lower than existing methane monitoring technologies. It is currently available in the United States, with plans for international expansion.\n\nVytelle claims the system can help cattle producers reduce their carbon footprint and prepare for potential future regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. The company is partnering with researchers to further develop the technology and collect more data on the relationship between feed efficiency, methane production, and animal performance.\n\nThe launch of this system comes as the agricultural industry faces growing pressure to address its environmental impact, particularly from livestock production. Vytelle's new technology provides a cost-effective solution for farmers to measure and manage their herd's methane emissions.",

The Nebraska Farm Bureau opposes eliminating the mandatory brand inspection program.\n\nMeanwhile, the Brand Committee is changing how it charges mileage for inspections. Effective January 19, 2026, the $20 per-inspection surcharge will be discontinued, and the committee will instead charge the actual mileage incurred by inspectors. This change comes after a complaint filed with the Nebraska Attorney General's Office questioning the committee's mileage fee authority.\n\nOther legislative proposals aim to preserve the Brand Committee while adjusting fee structures, such as raising inspection fee caps and potentially re-authorizing a mileage surcharge.

      "summary": "Today, the true indicator of content effectiveness is the time a user spends meaningfully engaged, as farmers are using AI-assisted tools and quick-scan platforms that often answer their questions without needing to click.\n\nAgWeb.com recently underwent a redesign to create a simpler, more focused reading experience and increase user engagement:\n- On desktop, there was a 54% increase in readers reaching 75% of an article and a 21% increase in readers reaching 90%, indicating deeper engagement.\n- On mobile, daily article pageviews per user increased by 33%, meaning more opportunities for brands to reach engaged readers.\n\nThe article states that in a typical visit, readers only absorb about 28% of page text, as 79% scan content rather than read word-for-word. Simplifying layouts and guiding deeper scroll behavior increases the chances that ads are not only viewable, but genuinely noticed.\n\nAttention time is a clearer indicator of real impact than click-through rate, as it measures whether users stayed with the content, scrolled with purpose, and consumed multiple articles. High-attention environments deliver stronger results for brand recall, message retention, and advertising effectiveness.\n\nThe article concludes that the improvements on AgWeb translate into more value for brands, providing a template for increasing engagement and attention. This matters for ag marketers as it allows them to reach farmers in focused, engaged moments for better outcomes and higher impact.",

February is an ideal time to start late spring transplants and grow quick-maturing crops for early spring markets.\n\nGreenhouse Basics:\n- Greenhouses trap thermal heat to warm plants, with some offering vents, climate controls, and irrigation systems.\n- Modular plastic greenhouses can raise temperatures up to 30°F higher. Low tunnels can raise temperatures 2-15°F, while cold frames can raise it 5-15°F.\n- Well-designed greenhouses with climate controls allow year-round growing.\n\nWhat to Grow:\n- Tomatoes and peppers benefit from early indoor planting, needing consistent warmth (at least 50°F) to germinate.\n- Brassicas like kale, cabbage, and cauliflower can be grown indoors to avoid pests and extreme cold.\n- Lettuces, potatoes, onions, and many flowers can also get a head start in the greenhouse.\n\nThe article provides guidance on selecting the right greenhouse type based on your climate and growing needs.

This is an improvement over the extremely mild winter of 2024, but not as favorable as the strong polar vortex in 2019 which caused up to 90% aphid mortality.\n\nFor alfalfa weevil, the article states that with soil temperatures only reaching a minimum of 15.4°F at one location, not much mortality is expected this year. Northern areas with less snow cover may see slight reductions in alfalfa weevil pressure.\n\nCorn rootworm forecasting is more complex, as their eggs overwinter in the soil. At the coldest 4 and 8-inch soil temperatures recorded (-19.4°F and -23.0°F), not much acute mortality is expected. Rootworm mortality depends on both temperature and duration of exposure.\n\nEmerald ash borer, while not a field crop pest, was also discussed. The article predicts 25% or more mortality in the northern half of the state after accounting for the insulation provided by ash tree bark.\n\nThe article recommends that farmers be proactive about scouting for soybean aphids this year, and consider aphid-resistant soybean varieties if available.

This is attributed to lower than expected soybean yields in the Midwest due to drought conditions.\n\nCorn prices have also risen by 5%, now averaging $4.75 per bushel, due to similar crop challenges in major corn-producing states.\n\nThe USDA forecasts an overall 4% decline in total crop production for 2026 compared to the previous year. This is expected to impact farm incomes, which are projected to drop by an average of 7% across the country.\n\nThe American Farm Bureau is urging Congress to expand crop insurance programs and disaster relief funding to help offset these losses for farmers. Spokesperson Mary Johnson emphasized the importance of supporting family farms during these challenging times.\n\nWeather forecasts indicate the drought conditions may persist through the summer, raising concerns about the 2027 growing season as well.

These retailers often lack the scale or capital to buy directly from factories.\n\n- Wholesalers break large production runs into smaller, manageable assortments and replenishment programs, keeping these outlets viable. They also democratize access to compliance, traceability, and quality standards.\n\n- Without wholesalers, retail assortments would narrow, buying would become more conservative, and out-of-stocks would increase. This would reduce cotton's retail footprint and concentrate demand among fewer players, increasing vulnerability across the supply chain.\n\n- The article cites expert Bob Antoshak, who states that this \"long tail\" of retail plays a meaningful role in sustaining cotton consumption.\n\n- The key takeaway for farmers is that wholesale distribution helps sustain the diversity of cotton demand.",
