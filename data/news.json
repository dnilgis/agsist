Expanding renewable fuel markets, particularly ethanol, can create significant new demand for corn. Similarly, increased use of soybean oil for biodiesel can boost soybean demand.\n\n5. McCormick argues this is a better path forward than relying on growth in export markets, which face increasing competition and trade policy uncertainties.\n\n6. Increasing domestic renewable fuel usage could provide a more stable and predictable outlet for corn and soybean farmers compared to volatile export markets.\n\nIn summary, the key recommendation from the ag economist is for farmers to focus on expanding domestic renewable fuel markets, especially ethanol and biodiesel, as the best way to boost long-term demand for their corn and soybean crops.",

This will increase costs for farmers.\n- Introducing a new \"Resilience Factor\" that will adjust premium rates based on climate change risks, potentially leading to higher premiums in high-risk areas.\n- Expanding eligibility for the Whole-Farm Revenue Protection program from $8.5 million in revenue to $20 million, allowing more medium-sized farms to participate.\n- Requiring crop insurance providers to offer policies that cover losses from extreme weather events like drought, floods, and heat waves.\n\nThese changes aim to make the crop insurance system more financially sustainable and resilient to climate change.

      "summary": "The U.S. cattle herd started 2026 slightly smaller than a year ago, with the total cattle and calves on farms and ranches at 86.2 million head as of January 1, 2026. This continues the industry's multi-year contraction.\n\nKey statistics:\n- Total cattle and calves: 86.2 million head (Jan. 1, 2026)\n- All cows and heifers that have calved: 37.2 million head\n- Beef cows: 27.6 million head (down 1% year-over-year) \n- Milk cows: 9.57 million head (up from last year)\n- 2025 calf crop: 32.9 million head (down from the prior year)\n- Cattle on feed: 13.8 million head (down 3% from 2025)\n\nThe report suggests a slow start to herd rebuilding, with a modest increase in beef replacement heifers but overall declines in beef cows and the calf crop. This points to continued tight near-term feeder supplies, which could support cattle prices if demand holds. \n\nFor cow-calf operators, the tight supplies and high calf/bred female prices reinforce the challenges of rebuilding the herd, which takes time. For stocker and feedlot operators, competition for available feeder cattle may remain elevated.\n\nThe data indicates any nationwide herd expansion is likely to be slow and uneven, shaped more by factors like forage conditions, replacement economics, and producer risk appetite than by headline prices.",

Farmers are encouraged to stay in close contact with their local FSA offices for updates on the 2023 program deadlines.\n\nThe delay is attributed to the USDA's focus on implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes $20 billion in new conservation funding. The USDA is likely prioritizing the new conservation programs, leading to the delay in announcing the 2023 ARC/PLC election.\n\nThe impact on farmers is increased uncertainty about their risk management decisions for the 2023 crop year.

      "summary": "Alistair Reynolds from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Forestry explains that this loud cracking sound occurs when trees go through a process called cold acclimation in the fall. This involves the tree relocating water from living cells to the spaces between cells, allowing ice crystals to form outside the cells. When temperatures suddenly fluctuate, the water in the cells can crystallize and expand, putting pressure on the wood fibers and causing the tree to split.\n\nFrost cracks are most common on the southern or southwestern side of trees, as that's where the sun warms the bark and causes partial de-acclimation. Younger trees and thin-barked species like maples, beech, and birch are more prone to this issue. While an exploding tree can sound dramatic, Reynolds notes that recovery is more common than total failure, unless the crack goes deep into the sapwood. Heavy snow or ice can exacerbate the structural damage. Last week in Nashville, an ice storm caused dozens of trees to crack and fall.\n\nOverall, while concerning, frost cracks do not pose a major public threat unless someone is in the woods during an event. The article does not provide any specific data, deadlines, or recommendations for farmers. However, it offers valuable scientific insights into this seasonal phenomenon impacting trees.",

      "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has changed a policy that could make it more difficult for shareholders to pass resolutions calling for food and agriculture companies to improve environmental and social outcomes. Shareholder resolutions have been used over the past two decades by advocates for change. The new SEC policy increases the ownership threshold required for shareholders to file resolutions, from $2,000 worth of shares to $25,000 worth. This change could undercut shareholder activism aimed at pressuring companies to address issues like climate change, labor rights, and animal welfare. The policy shift comes amid growing pressure on corporations to take action on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.",

      "summary": "The University of Minnesota Extension is offering a year-long Cover Crop Academy from June 2026 to May 2027. The academy is a hybrid course with in-person meetings at research centers in Lamberton, Waseca, and Westport, Minnesota, as well as online sessions every other month.\n\nThe program is designed for crop consultants, educators, agronomists, and those working for Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCD), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and other agencies. It will provide a deep dive into cover crops, addressing challenges and opportunities in Minnesota cropping systems.\n\nThe academy kicks off with in-person meetings in June 2026, where participants will visit cover crop research plots and learn about what is and is not working in their region. Participants will then develop their own small research trials to address cover crop unknowns. Online sessions will cover topics like cover crop planning, herbicide management, soil fertility, and cash crop considerations.\n\nThe program will wrap up in May 2027 with in-person meetings where participants can assess the results of their small plot trials. Certified Crop Advisor CEUs will be available, primarily in the soil and water, crop management, nutrient management, and pest management categories (15+).\n\nThe cost to participate in the UMN Extension Cover Crop Academy is $75, thanks to program sponsors that include the Minnesota Natural Resources Conservation Service, General Mills, and the Minnesota Office of Soil Health. Registration is limited and filled on a first-come, first-served basis, with a deadline of June 10, 2024.",

The acquisition was announced on January 28, 2026, just months after the Farmers' Almanac revealed it would cease operations following its 2026 edition due to financial pressures.\n\nThe new owner, Tim Konrad, founder and publisher of Unofficial Networks, plans to revive and expand future print editions of the Farmers' Almanac while maintaining its online presence. The Farmers' Almanac website will remain active, providing access to archived forecasts, seasonal content, and features.\n\nPeter Geiger, longtime publisher and editor emeritus of the Farmers' Almanac, welcomed the transition and expressed confidence that Konrad will honor the publication's heritage and carry it forward for generations to come.\n\nThe Farmers' Almanac, founded in 1818 in Morristown, New Jersey, and later based in Maine, is one of America's oldest continuously published periodicals. Its content has long included weather forecasts, planting calendars, moon phases, astronomical data, fishing forecasts, home remedies, and folklore, earning it a place in households, barns, and workshops nationwide.\n\nFuture plans for the Farmers' Almanac include restoring the familiar annual print edition and adapting the publication for modern audiences. The publication will remain accessible online, as it enters its next chapter under new leadership.",
