Indonesia is an attractive market, being the 4th most populous nation and a major importer of processed egg ingredients. A new 2025 U.S.-Indonesia trade deal has removed tariffs on over 99% of U.S. agricultural products.\n\nAmerican Egg Board CEO Emily Metz said exports are a \"critical and largely untapped\" opportunity for U.S. egg producers to create new demand, improve returns, and increase stability. Trade mission delegate Sean Delano of Mid-States Specialty Eggs noted the international appetite for U.S. egg quality and attributes like safety, production standards, organic, and halal.\n\nThe USDA trade mission agenda includes networking, meetings with importers and officials, facility tours, and cultural events.

Some floor-standing boxes even had an overhanging lid that allowed the box to double as a dining table. Rare floor-standing boxes incorporated a drawer for storing utensils.\n\nTo address dough getting stuck in the box's seams, early settlers created iron dough box scrapers, resembling small hoes with sharp corners to clean the interior. While utilitarian, some scrapers were decoratively crafted by blacksmiths with designs, names, and dates.\n\nDough boxes and scrapers were essential tools for pioneer Ohio families to efficiently bake large batches of bread on a weekly basis.

NT+CR had the lowest net return due to cover crop management costs ($55/ac), though these can be offset by cost-share programs.\n- The study will continue in 2026 to track longer-term soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics under the conservation systems.\n\nThe project was funded by the Illinois Soybean Association and aims to help growers maintain productivity and profitability while using reduced tillage and cover crops to protect soil.",

      "summary": "The Texas Agriculture Commissioner, Sid Miller, is calling for a federal tax credit to encourage cattle producers to retain heifers and rebuild the shrinking U.S. cattle herd. \n\nThe U.S. cattle herd is currently at its smallest size since the early 1950s, at 86.2 million head as of January 1, 2026. Beef cows, calf crop totals, and cattle on feed have all declined, indicating slow and uneven herd expansion.\n\nMiller's proposed \"Heifer Retention Tax Credit\" would allow cow-calf operators to receive a federal tax credit for retaining heifers instead of selling them into the strong market. This is aimed at offsetting the short-term financial tradeoff of herd expansion.\n\nFactors tempering producer expansion plans include limited forage, rising input costs, and market uncertainty, despite strong beef demand. Miller is urging Congress to consider the tax credit as part of the next Farm Bill, calling it a \"crisis\" that requires immediate action to rebuild the national cattle herd and increase beef production.\n\nEconomists note that herd rebuilding is a multi-year process, so policies that reduce risk for cow-calf operators could influence their decisions on retaining heifers in 2026. Miller framed the issue as crucial to promoting a strong, American beef supply.",

      "summary": "S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in July 2025 is a major concern for Canada's consul general, as trade predictability is crucial for Minnesota's agricultural industry. Beth Richardson, Canada's consul general in Minneapolis, stated that if the USMCA is renewed for 16 more years, it would provide the much-needed predictability for businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nThe three countries combined account for around $1.8 trillion in annual trade, making it one of the most integrated economic regions globally. Agriculture is a central part of this relationship, particularly in the Upper Midwest, where cross-border supply chains are constantly in motion.\n\nAndrea Vaubel, the deputy commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, emphasized the importance of stability, noting the state's position as a major producer of livestock, grain, and specialty crops. Richardson said the successful review of the USMCA would be a positive signal for restoring confidence across the supply chain.\n\nThe article also highlighted the impact of tariff uncertainty, such as the briefly imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports of steel and aluminum last February, which affected the affordability of potash, a critical fertilizer for farmers. Richardson and Vaubel stressed that unpredictability is the most challenging aspect for producers and agribusinesses.\n\nAlejandra Bologna, the head consul of Mexico in St. Paul, stated that 85% of the goods traded between Mexico and the U.S. are under the USMCA treatment and are not affected by tariffs. She also noted that trade between the two countries has increased tenfold since 1994, demonstrating the deep economic integration within the North American region.\n\nThe article provided examples of the integration, such as Canada supplying over 90% of the oats used by U.S. food processing facilities, and the U.S. importing nearly 7 million hogs from Canada each year for processing and genetics, while also exporting processed pork back to Canada.\n\nOverall, the key takeaways are the importance of trade predictability, the need to avoid tariff uncertainty, the deep economic integration within the North American region, and the mutually dependent agricultural relationship between Canada and Minnesota.",

      "summary": "S. beef herd has not yet recovered, with a 1% national decline and a 30,000 head drop in Texas' herd, the nation's largest beef producer. However, Texas producers held back 50,000 more heifers for future herd growth, an 8% increase in replacements.\n\nExperts anticipate a slower cattle herd rebuild and tighter cattle supplies that will impact prices throughout the supply chain. Calf prices are already high, with 500-600 lb steers averaging $450/cwt in Texas compared to $326/cwt last year. Cow-calf producer margins are expected to remain strong, potentially even better than last year, due to lower feed costs and sustained demand.\n\nThe rebuilding process appears more measured than past post-drought recoveries, with high bred-heifer values of $4,000-$5,000 incentivizing some producers to sell rather than retain for herd growth. Texas' long-term cattle capacity has also been reduced by urban expansion, land fragmentation, and conversion to non-agricultural uses.\n\nEmerging drought in Texas could further influence producer decisions. Experts expect calf prices to go even higher in 2026-2027 due to the tightened supplies, though the year's outlook will depend heavily on drought conditions.\n\nThe recent winter storm across Texas brought freezing temperatures, snow, and ice, posing significant challenges for livestock producers. While cattle were generally in fair to good condition, some losses were reported, and supplemental feeding was widespread. The extreme weather also delayed fieldwork and impacted crop conditions, especially for winter wheat.",

This news was welcomed by the biofuels and soybean industry.\n\nThe 45Z program, created under President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and amended last year under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, gives soybean oil a better standing with a higher credit, going from 30 cents per gallon to 60 cents per gallon.\n\nTom Verry, the director of outreach and development for Clean Fuels Alliance America, stated that the guidance will kickstart an industry that has been in a state of limbo for the last year. The tax credit is projected to result in a record use of 15.5 billion pounds of soybean oil in biofuels this year, more than half of U.S. production.\n\nScott Metzger, the American Soybean Association (ASA) President and Ohio farmer, expressed excitement about the credit news, stating that it will help build domestic markets for U.S. soybeans. Steve Censky, the ASA CEO, also noted that the credit news should be paired with finalizing the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) blending targets to complement the work of the Treasury and Congress.\n\nThe clean fuel production credit provides businesses an income tax credit for clean transportation fuel produced domestically after December 31, 2024, and sold by December 31, 2029.

      "summary": "The Hiroshima University-led project has secured a $1.8 million grant from the Gates Foundation to develop a way to store bull semen using simple refrigeration instead of costly liquid nitrogen. This technology could remove a major barrier to modern dairy cattle breeding that has long excluded farmers in low-resource regions.\n\nThe project, headed by Professor Masayuki Shimada, builds on the team's 2019 discovery that identified functional differences between X-bearing (female-producing) and Y-bearing (male-producing) sperm. They developed a simplified and low-cost sex selection technique that helps farmers reliably produce more female calves. This technique has already been deployed at dairy farming sites in India.\n\nHowever, expanding the technology's use globally requires a safe method of transporting and storing the processed sperm. The new grant will allow the team to develop a storage method that allows bovine sperm to be stored at about 5 degrees Celsius, eliminating the need for liquid nitrogen. This could make artificial insemination much easier to use.\n\nThe project is being carried out in collaboration with agricultural organizations and government-affiliated research institutes in India, along with research groups within Hiroshima University. The technology is expected to increase milk production, stabilize incomes for small-scale dairy farmers, and improve children's nutritional status in regions like India and Africa.\n\nShimada's laboratory already hosts doctoral students from government agencies in countries where the technology is expected to roll out, including Nigeria, Mozambique, and Bangladesh. A framework is also in place to train local experts and roll out the technology on the ground.",

      "summary": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented a new Herbicide Strategy that has elevated the importance of adjuvants for farmers. Adjuvants, which were previously considered optional add-ons, are now essential tools for reducing pesticide drift. This shift means that farmers must now factor adjuvants into their budgets and application plans. \n\nThe EPA's strategy aims to mitigate the risks associated with herbicide drift, which can damage neighboring crops and negatively impact the environment. As a result, the use of adjuvants has become a necessary component of herbicide application to ensure compliance with the new regulations.\n\nFarmers must now carefully consider the selection and use of adjuvants to optimize the performance of their herbicides while minimizing drift. This may require additional investments in equipment, training, and product costs. The impact on farmer budgets and operations will vary depending on the specific crops and herbicides used.\n\nExperts recommend that farmers work closely with their suppliers and advisors to understand the new EPA requirements and select the most appropriate adjuvants for their needs. Proper application techniques and ongoing monitoring will be crucial to ensuring compliance and protecting crops and the environment.",

Corn tortilla chips are the most consumed snack, with farmers planting over 90 million acres of corn annually, though facing historically low prices (projected to lose $173/acre in 2026). Potato chips are also very popular, but potato farmers faced $700 million in losses in 2025 due to rising costs outpacing market prices. Over 1 billion chicken wings will be eaten, supplied by a $45.4 billion poultry industry, though growers have limited ability to benefit from high wholesale/retail prices. Dairy products in foods like pizza and dips rely on record milk production, but the U.S. has seen dairy farm numbers drop over 60% since 2005 due to economic pressures. AFBF President Zippy Duvall stated farmers are facing an \"economic crisis\" and need more support to ensure the food supply, despite the abundance consumers enjoy during the Super Bowl.",

      "summary": "The system captures water from subsurface tile drains during wet periods, stores it in a pond, and then reuses it for irrigation during drought. This was part of a pilot project with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.\n\nThe Blairs' system stores water in a pond and pumps it through an irrigation pivot on 125 acres. While recent rains have limited their ability to test the full impact, Iowa State data has shown yield increases from the system. Experts like Chris Hay of Hay Water Solutions say the system can provide a 3-inch supplemental water supply during dry summer periods.\n\nAn economic analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund found drainage water recycling can boost crop yield income by $130-$146 per acre annually, while saving $10-$20 per acre in operating costs. The practice also provides water quality benefits by reducing nutrient runoff.\n\nHowever, these systems require a significant upfront investment of $2-$3 million, plus ongoing maintenance. Experts recommend having a pond that can store 4-6 inches of water for the irrigated area. Funding will likely require both private farmer investment and public/outside support.\n\nThe Blairs advise other farmers interested in this to seek local help and expertise to plan and implement the system. They are now looking to add features like a fertilizer injection system to further optimize the setup.",

This is due to increased poultry production, even as wings remain a hugely popular Super Bowl snack.\n\nThe article cites Texas A&M AgriLife Extension economist David Anderson, who says wings have become a cultural tradition for the Super Bowl, similar to hot dogs on the 4th of July. He notes that wing production is limited by animal physiology, but overall U.S. production this year is estimated at 17.5 billion wings, with about 8.5% consumed just during the Super Bowl.\n\nAnderson says the Super Bowl represents the pinnacle of chicken wing demand each year, and that he will personally be making wings to enjoy for the big game.",
