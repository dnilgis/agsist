These byproducts provide a cost-effective source of energy and protein that can be incorporated into various stages of beef cattle production, including cow-calf, backgrounding, and finishing systems.\n\nAccording to research by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) can replace up to 40% of a finishing diet without impacting cattle performance. At current prices, using DDGS can reduce feed costs by $20-$30 per head compared to traditional corn-based diets.\n\nIn backgrounding operations, DDGS can be used to replace up to 50% of the forage in the diet, increasing average daily gain by 0.5 lbs and reducing feed costs by $0.10-$0.20 per lb of gain. For cow-calf producers, DDGS can be fed as a protein supplement, reducing the need for more expensive protein sources like cottonseed meal.\n\nExperts recommend that beef producers work closely with their nutritionists to properly formulate distillers byproduct-based diets to optimize cattle performance and economic returns.

Successful anglers tend to rely more on their own knowledge, while less successful ones orient more towards other fishers. After a catch, anglers intensify their search in the immediate area, and this effect is amplified in high-density areas. The decision to leave a spot is primarily driven by the time without a catch, with the first catch extending the duration of stay.\n\nKey findings also include differences by age and gender - women relied more on social information than men, and older participants stayed longer at locations and were less likely to avoid unsuccessful areas. Fishing was more dynamic when lakes were rich in fish.\n\nThe research team, which includes scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, the Cluster of Excellence \"Science of Intelligence\" at TU Berlin, and the University of Eastern Finland, say the methodological approach could be useful for studying human cognition in real-world conditions and applied to resource and conservation management.",

Key elements of the proposed strategy include setting new performance standards, enhancing testing and sampling, and improving coordination with state and industry partners.\n\nThe initiative aims to achieve a 25% reduction in Salmonella illnesses linked to poultry within 5 years. Currently, Salmonella causes an estimated 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the U.S. each year. Poultry products are a major source, responsible for about 23% of these cases.\n\nStakeholders including farmers, processors, consumer groups, and public health experts are encouraged to submit comments on the strategy's feasibility and potential impact on their operations or communities. FSIS will use the feedback to finalize the new Salmonella action plan later in 2023.",

      "summary": "About 60% of U.S. sugar comes from sugar beets, which are large root crops typically grown in colder climates like Minnesota, Idaho, and North Dakota. The remaining 40% comes from sugar cane, a tropical grass crop grown in Florida and Louisiana.\n\nTo make sugar, the plants are harvested and the sugar juice is extracted. For sugar beets, this involves washing, slicing, and soaking the roots in water. For sugar cane, the stalks are crushed, soaked, and squeezed. The extracted juice is then filtered, boiled to thicken it, and finally crystallized. \n\nThe sugar crystals from sugar beets are then dried and packaged, ready for use. Sugar cane, on the other hand, first produces a raw sugar that still needs further refining. This raw sugar is transported to a refinery where it is melted, filtered, and recrystallized to remove remaining impurities.\n\nThe sugar production process also yields other useful byproducts. Molasses is produced from the centrifuge step, and is used in animal feed, baking, and pharmaceuticals. The plant residues like beet pulp and cane stalks are also utilized, often as animal feed or fuel.\n\nInterestingly, sugar is naturally white, and does not require any artificial whitening or additives. It is a simple, natural product that has an indefinite shelf life. While sometimes vilified, sugar can be part of a balanced diet when consumed in moderation.",

The system captures water from subsurface tile drains during wet periods, stores it in a pond, and then reuses it for supplemental irrigation during droughts.\n\nBuilding the pond was a larger conservation project than the Blairs had done before, but they saw potential benefits like reduced nutrient runoff and increased yields. While recent rains have limited their need for irrigation, Iowa State data has shown yield increases from the system. Experts like Chris Hay of Hay Water Solutions estimate the system can provide 3-4 inches of supplemental water per year on 125 acres.\n\nAn economic analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund found drainage water recycling can boost crop yield income by $130-$146 per acre annually, and save $10-$20 per acre in operating costs. The practice can also improve water quality by reducing nutrient runoff. However, these systems have high upfront costs of $2-3 million.\n\nThe Blairs recommend that farmers interested in drainage water recycling seek local expertise to design and implement the system. They are now looking to add features like a fertilizer injection system to further optimize their recycling setup. Overall, the practice shows promise but requires significant investment that may need public-private funding partnerships to be feasible for more farmers.",

In this case, Bayer will argue that it was following established laws and standards by not having a cancer warning on glyphosate, as the label was approved by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nGough acknowledged that Bayer has already publicly spent more than $12 billion on lawsuits over glyphosate. However, the company has won more cases than it has lost, with a 15-11 record, including nine consecutive wins. Bayer cites the lack of convincing scientific evidence that glyphosate causes cancer as the reason for its success in court.\n\nIf Bayer wins the Supreme Court case, it could help quell the tide of lawsuits, as thousands of claims are still in the system. However, Gough said the company may eventually have to exit the glyphosate business, which would be \"a bad day, not just for Bayer, but for the growers in the United States.\" This is because the only other manufacturer of the herbicide is in China.\n\nThe constant litigation over glyphosate also provides a template for trial lawyers to go after other pesticides, making crop protection companies less likely to invest in developing new chemistries. Luther Markwart, CEO and executive vice president of the American Sugarbeet Growers Association, said the association is working on an amicus brief in the case going to the Supreme Court, as the development of Roundup Ready sugarbeets was a significant advancement for weed control in sugarbeets.",

      "summary": "The National Chicken Council estimates 1.48 billion chicken wings will be consumed around Super Bowl LX, which would be enough to circle the Earth's equator more than three times.\n\nWholesale chicken wing prices are $1.12 per pound this year, up from 99 cents per pound at the start of 2026 but well below the $1.99 per pound price last year, $2.65 per pound in 2024, and $3.80 per pound in 2022. \n\nAround 17.5 billion wings are expected to be produced this year, meaning 8.5% of U.S. chicken wing production will be consumed during the Super Bowl. The article notes that chicken wings have become a cultural phenomenon, evolving from an \"afterthought cut of meat\" to one of the most sought-after items during sporting events.\n\nThe article cites comments from Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service economist David Anderson, who explains that the popularity of chicken wings for Super Bowl snacking has \"melded pop culture, food and sports\" in a way that has elevated them. Anderson plans to make wings for the big game himself this year.",

      "summary": "The U.S. cattle herd started 2026 with 86.2 million head, slightly lower than the previous year. This continues the industry's multi-year contraction.\n\nKey numbers:\n- Total cattle and calves: 86.2 million head (as of Jan. 1, 2026)\n- Beef cows: 27.6 million head (down 1% year-over-year) \n- Milk cows: 9.57 million head (up from last year)\n- 2025 calf crop: 32.9 million head (down from the prior year)\n- Cattle on feed: 13.8 million head (down 3% from 2025)\n\nThe report signals a slow start to herd rebuilding, as beef replacement heifers increased only modestly to 4.71 million head. With fewer beef cows and a smaller calf crop, near-term feeder supplies remain constrained, which is a tailwind for cattle prices.\n\nFor producers, the tight supplies mean strong calf and bred female prices, but rebuilding the herd will take time. Stocker and feedlot operators face elevated competition for feeder cattle. Expansion is likely to be slow and uneven, shaped more by forage conditions, replacement economics, and producer risk appetite than headline prices.\n\nThe data was collected by the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service through surveys of around 35,000 operators across the country in early January 2026.",
