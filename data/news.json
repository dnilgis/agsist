Data from the University of Nebraska shows that cattle fed 15-40% distillers grains in their diet had 3-5% greater feed efficiency and gained 0.2-0.4 lbs more per day compared to cattle on grain-only diets.\n\nThe supply of distillers grains has increased as ethanol production has grown, with over 37 million tons produced annually in the U.S. This provides ample availability for beef producers, especially those located near ethanol plants. Incorporating distillers feeds can be particularly beneficial for cow-calf, backgrounding, and feedlot operations.\n\nExperts recommend that producers work closely with their nutritionist to determine the optimal inclusion rate of distillers grains based on the cattle's age, weight, and production stage.

Successful anglers relied more on their own knowledge, while less successful ones oriented more towards other fishers. After a catch, anglers intensified their search nearby, which was amplified in high-density areas. The decision to leave a spot was driven mainly by the time since the last catch.\n\nThere were consistent differences based on gender and age - women relied more on social information than men, and older participants stayed longer at locations. Fish abundance also affected decision-making, with anglers changing spots more quickly when lakes were rich in fish.\n\nThe researchers say this methodological approach combining field measurements and computational models provides a blueprint for future studies of human cognition in real-world conditions.

While production has become more efficient, cattle herd sizes have been decreasing, leading to the projected decline in overall beef supply.

This was part of a pilot project with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. \n\nBuilding the pond was a larger investment than most conservation projects the Blairs have done, costing $2-3 million upfront plus ongoing maintenance. Their area has seen more timely rains recently, so they haven't been able to fully calculate the yield benefits yet. However, Iowa State data shows there are yield increases from the system. The pivot is used primarily later in the growing season when Iowa typically experiences drought.\n\nAn economic analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund found that drainage water recycling can boost crop yield income by $130-$146 per acre annually, and save $10-$20 per acre in equipment and field costs. It also provides water quality benefits by reducing nutrient runoff. \n\nThe EDF is hoping to see more investment in research and funding to make these systems more feasible for farmers. Expert Chris Hay advises that producers interested in adding a system need to plan for a sizable pond, around 4-6 inches of storage. Farmer Kellie Blair recommends seeking local help for the planning and implementation.\n\nThe Blairs are now looking to add features like a fertilizer injection system to further optimize their drainage water recycling setup.",

      "summary": "The National Chicken Council estimates 1.48 billion chicken wings will be consumed during Super Bowl LX, which would circle the Earth's equator more than 3 times if laid end-to-end. \n\nWing prices have fallen from $3.80 per pound in 2022 to $2.65 per pound in 2024, and are now at $1.12 per pound wholesale, up from 99 cents at the start of 2026. This is lower than the $1.99 per pound price the same week last year.\n\nThe increased popularity of chicken wings, mirroring the rise of beef brisket, has transformed them from an afterthought into one of the most valuable poultry cuts. Around 17.5 billion wings are expected to be produced this year, with 8.5% consumed during the Super Bowl alone.\n\nTexas A&M AgriLife Extension economist David Anderson attributes the growth in chicken wing popularity to the way they have become intertwined with pop culture, food, and major sporting events like the Super Bowl. He says wings have become a tradition, like hot dogs on the 4th of July.",

      "summary": "The U.S. cattle herd started 2026 slightly smaller than a year ago, continuing the industry's multi-year contraction. As of January 1, 2026, the U.S. had 86.2 million head of cattle and calves, down from the previous year. \n\nKey statistics:\n- Total cattle and calves: 86.2 million head (Jan 1, 2026)\n- All cows and heifers that have calved: 37.2 million head\n- Beef cows: 27.6 million head (down 1% year-over-year) \n- Milk cows: 9.57 million head (up from last year)\n- 2025 calf crop: 32.9 million head (down from prior year)\n- Cattle on feed: 13.8 million head (down 3% from 2025)\n\nThis report suggests any broad-based herd rebuild is still slow, with beef cows down 1% and the calf crop smaller. Replacement heifers increased modestly, but the overall picture points to constrained near-term feeder supplies. \n\nFor cow-calf operators, the tight supplies and strong calf/bred female prices make rebuilding challenging, as it takes years for retained heifers to impact production. Stocker and feedlot operators face elevated competition for available feeder cattle. Expansion, if it comes, is likely to be slow and uneven, driven more by forage, economics, and risk appetite than headline prices.",
