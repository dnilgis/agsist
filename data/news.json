The service costs around $600/year but has \"more than saved\" them by helping with optimal planting windows and chemical applications. \n\nThe article notes that private agricultural forecasting tools have expanded in the last decade, using multiple forecast models and teams of professional meteorologists. These services can provide forecasts 7-10 days out compared to 2-3 days from local meteorologists.\n\nThe new Ohio mesonet stations installed by OSU Extension collect data on temperature, humidity, precipitation, soil conditions and more. This denser network of local weather monitoring aims to enable more accurate short-term forecasting, as well as innovations like disease/pest scouting alerts and growing degree-day modeling for farmers.\n\nOverall, the article highlights how both public and private hyper-local weather data is transforming farm management decisions in Ohio, from optimizing planting timing to improving pesticide and fungicide applications.",

Brown encouraged farmers to reduce land and equipment costs, noting Brazil's cost-effective equipment utilization.\n\nCrop producers are facing high input costs, with land rents, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed costs continuing to increase even during low profit margins. There has also been uncertainty around trade agreements and tariffs.\n\nBrown provided an economic outlook, projecting flat disposable income for the next few years, a gradual decline in global economic development due to increased tariffs, and slowing growth in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel without further policy changes.\n\nHowever, the specialist sees potential for improved crop prices in 2026, with USDA estimates of a 4% increase in soybean prices, 10% in corn, 13% in wheat, and 4% increases in canola, barley and cattle. This is due to increasing demand, policy changes, and the potential for smaller crops.\n\nDespite the price increases, Brown said many of these prices still may not cover the cost of production.

Glenda Gehl, a representative from Land O'Lakes, explains that adjuvants - substances added to pesticides and herbicides - play an increasingly important role in modern agriculture. \n\nAdjuvants can improve spray coverage, droplet size, and penetration, leading to more effective and efficient pesticide and herbicide applications. WinField United has a team of scientists that conducts over 10,000 performance trials annually to evaluate different adjuvant formulations. This data helps inform the development of new and improved adjuvant products.\n\nOne new adjuvant, Unite, was recently introduced by WinField United. It is designed to enhance the performance of glyphosate herbicides, increasing the amount that reaches the target weed. Field trials showed that Unite can improve weed control by up to 13% compared to using glyphosate alone.\n\nGehl emphasizes that selecting the right adjuvant is crucial for farmers to get the most out of their pesticide and herbicide applications. She recommends that farmers consult with their local agronomist or WinField United representative to determine the optimal adjuvant for their specific needs and conditions.",

NAFTA and USMCA have enabled over 10-fold growth in this market since 1994.\n\n- Access to the Canadian dairy market remains a frustration, with calls for Canada to administer dairy tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) in a way that maximizes their use.\n\n- The Agricultural Coalition for the USMCA, representing over 40 ag groups, stressed the agreement's importance to the U.S. economy and rural America. They urged its renewal, despite President Trump previously suggesting he may withdraw from it.\n\n- During the hearing, former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady testified that USMCA is vital, especially as China seeks to compete. \n\n- Under questioning, Brady said the USMCA review process offers an opportunity to ensure Mexico complies with the 1944 Water Treaty.\n\n- Idaho dairyman Ted Vander Schaaf, a member-owner of the Northwest Dairy Association, testified that USMCA is essential for dairy farm incomes, planning, and investment across rural America.\n\nThe article highlights the critical importance of USMCA for U.S. dairy exports, particularly to Mexico, and the need to address persistent issues with Canada's dairy market access as the agreement comes up for renewal.",

In the 1940s, it was common for communities to gather on ponds to skate during the winter months when school was out. \n\nThe author's mother was the driving force behind the skating parties, scouting for used ice skates and encouraging the digging of a large farm pond. She would help the children prepare, providing extra gloves and socks to make the skates fit. \n\nThe children spent time shoveling snow off the pond before skating. They would practice turns, spins, and \"Crack the Whip\" until their fingers, toes, and noses were frozen. Afterwards, they would warm up with hot chocolate and marshmallows, already planning their next trip to the pond.\n\nThe author fondly recalls the carefree joy and imagination of those winter skating days, where they felt like \"lovely skaters dressed in flowing costumes\" despite their well-worn coveralls. The peaceful silence and community spirit of those times on the farm pond left a lasting impression.",

Key details:\n\n- The bill text largely reflects the Republican proposal from 2024, but faces opposition from Democrats who have vowed to block the bill.\n- The bill proposes revamping the existing farm safety net programs, including crop insurance, commodity subsidies, and conservation programs.\n- Republican leaders aim to cut spending on food stamps (SNAP) by $20 billion over 10 years, a move opposed by Democrats.\n- The bill would expand crop insurance premium subsidies and increase payment limits for commodity programs.\n- It would also consolidate conservation programs and direct more funding towards regional conservation partnerships.\n- Farmers have been calling for overdue investments in the agricultural sector, but the partisan divide makes the bill's passage uncertain.\n\nNo specific expert quotes or impacts on farmers were provided in the article summary. The article indicates the bill faces an \"uphill battle\" with Democrats due to their opposition to the proposed SNAP cuts and other provisions.",

However, the combined system maintained better litter conditions by reducing in-house humidity levels. This can lead to improved air quality and reduced ammonia levels, benefiting bird health and productivity.\n\nImplementing the combined sprinkler-evaporative cooling system could help broiler farmers manage heat stress more efficiently while reducing water consumption for cooling.

      "summary": "The USDA has unveiled a plan to address \"agricultural lawfare\" - the use of lawsuits to undermine agricultural practices. On February 12, 2026, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the Farmer and Rancher Freedom Framework at an event with federal agencies and farmers/ranchers.\n\nThe key elements of the plan include:\n- Establishing a new USDA Office of Legal Defense to provide farmers/ranchers with legal support against lawsuits\n- Implementing a \"Right to Farm\" law to protect farmers/ranchers from nuisance lawsuits\n- Creating a USDA Legal Defense Fund to cover legal costs for farmers/ranchers\n- Expanding the scope of the Farmer and Rancher Disaster Program to include legal expenses\n\nThe goal is to help farmers/ranchers defend themselves against lawsuits that aim to restrict agricultural practices. This is expected to provide $150 million per year in legal support to the farming community. Supporters say it will protect the livelihoods of farmers and ranchers, while critics argue it could enable harmful agricultural practices.",

Slow-growing herbs like basil, oregano, and rosemary should be planted in February to ensure mature transplants.\n3. Tomatoes should be started indoors in February, especially for growers with short seasons. Determinate varieties are best for short seasons, while indeterminate varieties are good for year-round harvests.\n4. Peppers are notoriously slow to germinate and benefit from an early start in February. They can take up to a month to sprout and require a heat mat and ample light.\n5. Brassicas like broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower thrive in the cool weather of mid to late winter and early spring.\n6. Lettuce is an easy-to-grow green that can be started directly outdoors in February, as it can handle a little late frost.\n7. Carrots and parsnips should be direct-sown outdoors under row cover in February, as their deep taproots are sensitive to root disturbance.\n8. Onions and leeks should be planted in February to ensure healthy transplants when the ground warms.\n9. Farmers in cold climates can use protected environments like greenhouses, cold frames, and low/high tunnels to start seeds in February.",

Farmers are advised to scout fields and report any confirmed cases to the Plant Disease Diagnostic Clinic.  \n\nFusarium head blight (FHB) is also a concern, as the moderate temperatures and adequate precipitation this season create conditions favorable for the disease. FHB can limit yields and produce the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON or vomitoxin), which can lead to grain being discounted or rejected at elevators if levels exceed 2 parts per million (ppm). Farmers will need to manage this disease.\n\nThe article was written on May 20, 2024 by Damon Smith, Extension Field Crops Pathologist, and Shawn Conley, Extension Soybean and Small Grains Agronomist, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
