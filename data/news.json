      "summary": "John Mays, a specialist with Central Life Sciences, warns that farmers often don't pay close enough attention to crops in the bin, thinking a occasional probe at the top is sufficient. However, Mays cautions that this approach can be risky, as pests, moisture, and temperature issues can develop unseen in the lower portions of the grain. \n\nThe article recommends that farmers regularly monitor stored grain, checking temperature and moisture levels throughout the bin. Mays advises using aeration systems to maintain ideal conditions and prevent spoilage. He also suggests applying protective treatments like insecticides to control pests and preserve grain quality during extended storage periods. \n\nProper grain bin management is crucial, as many farmers are holding onto crops longer due to market conditions. Mays stresses the need for vigilance, noting that neglecting stored grain can result in significant losses for farmers. By closely monitoring grain and taking proactive steps, farmers can protect their valuable crops and maximize returns.",

      "summary": "In 2024, severe rainfall disrupted planting, leading to a nearly one-third decline in cotton acreage. While producers hoped for better conditions in 2025, a combination of drought and wet weather early on resulted in a significant drop in cotton yields. The state average fell to only 860 pounds per acre, at or below the break-even point for most growers. \n\nInternationally, tariffs and rising cotton exports from Brazil have also impacted the industry, altering pricing and global demand for American cotton. In a typical year, 80% of U.S. cotton is exported, often to China and other textile producers. However, Brazil has now surpassed the U.S. as the world's top cotton exporter.  \n\nAs a result, Tennessee producers are looking to diversify their operations and may exclude cotton in 2026. One farmer, Scott Farmer, recently sold his cotton picker and will instead grow more grains and other crops. Tyson Raper, cotton and small grains Extension specialist, notes there is uncertainty whether the 18 cotton gins in Tennessee will have enough cotton to remain viable. \n\nEconomists predict that up to 30% of Tennessee farm operations are under severe financial stress heading into 2026. The UT Extension MANAGE program is providing one-on-one assistance to help producers evaluate their situation and improve their financial management. Overall, the combination of poor weather, unstable markets, and rising costs have made cotton production unviable for many Tennessee farmers.",

The event will focus on air quality and ingredient innovation in the feed industry.\n\nRenderers play a key role in sustainable agriculture by converting animal byproducts into valuable feed ingredients. This helps reduce food waste and the environmental impact of livestock production. Renderers recover about 50% of the original live weight of livestock and convert it into protein meals, fats, and other ingredients used in animal feed.\n\nStarkey will discuss how renderers are innovating to further improve the sustainability of feed ingredients. This includes developing new processing techniques to reduce emissions and energy use. Renderers are also exploring ways to upcycle more waste streams into high-value feed products.\n\nFor farmers, the availability of sustainable, high-quality feed ingredients from renderers is crucial. It allows them to meet consumer demand for environmentally-friendly animal products while maintaining animal health and productivity.",

Over $1.89 billion in aid will be distributed to livestock producers affected by drought, flooding, and wildfires in 2023 and 2024. Payments will be made to eligible beef, dairy, bison, equine, sheep, and goat producers across the U.S. The USDA estimates that nearly 370,000 operations will receive ELRP assistance. Payments will be based on a producer's 2021 livestock inventories. Producers do not need to apply for the ELRP, as eligibility and payments will be automatically processed. This final round of ELRP payments completes the USDA's livestock disaster assistance efforts for 2023 and 2024. Farmers and ranchers impacted by extreme weather events are encouraged to work with their local USDA Service Center to access all available disaster assistance programs.",

      "summary": "Rosenberg argues that the American industrial food system is an asset rather than a liability. It was released in February 2026.\n\nThe authors believe the current industrial food system provides more nutritious, varied, fresh, and affordable options than ever before. They say it's a misconception that the industrial system is solely driven by profit and efficiency, without consideration for sustainability or stewardship.\n\nRosenberg, an associate professor at Duke University, has expertise in rural history and the history of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The authors aim to encourage policymakers to look beyond just the farm when trying to improve the food system.\n\nThe authors define \"industrial\" food as being scalable and standardized in inputs and outputs, rather than relying on alternative methods like organic or local production. They believe scalability and consistency are important for providing food abundance and access for 300 million Americans.\n\nWhile the authors don't dismiss the value of some organic or regenerative practices, they argue that an overemphasis on these ideological labels can divert from practical, outcome-driven solutions. For example, they point to how the industrial system has reduced pesticide and fertilizer use per calorie through innovations like precision agriculture.\n\nThe key is continuing to apply smart innovations and common-sense policies to further improve the industrial food system, rather than automatically favoring small-scale, local alternatives, according to the authors.",

Fines for non-compliance would be $10-$200.\n\n- Supporters argue this will help ensure fair pay for hard-working farm laborers, many of whom struggle to afford the food they harvest. Critics warn it will raise consumer food prices.\n\n- The bills have passed the House and are now being considered by the Senate. This is the third time the legislation has been introduced, but the first time it may not face a veto.\n\n- Key sponsors are Del. Adele McClure and Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy. Critics include Del. Wendell Walker.\n\n- Small farmers reportedly support the bill, saying they already pay over $15/hour to attract workers they depend on. Larger farms are seen as the \"bad actors\" paying very low wages.",

Kale - Feeds the soil, people, livestock, and can be a specialty market crop. Needs slightly warmer soil of at least 45°F. Resistant varieties recommended in disease-prone areas.\n\n3. Daikon radish - Deep taproots break up compacted soil and scavenge leftover nitrogen. Requires soil temperature of at least 65°F.\n\n4. Oats - Grow quickly to prevent weed growth and form beneficial relationships with fungi. Can be sown with peas for nitrogen fixing. Tolerate temperatures down to 20°F.\n\n5. Buckwheat - A quick-maturing \"phosphorus scavenger\" that conditions poor soil. Can be used as a mulch after flowering.\n\nFarmers should consider their local climate and use low tunnels if needed to provide extra warmth and protection for the cover crops during cold weather.

Key beneficiaries include U.S. corn and soybean farmers, who will see increased exports of 4 million metric tons and 1.5 million metric tons respectively. The deal also provides access for U.S. beef and pork, with Taiwan agreeing to lift bans on ractopamine, a feed additive used in American livestock. Additionally, the agreement streamlines regulatory processes and reduces tariffs on many U.S. farm goods. Experts estimate this trade deal could add $1 billion in annual sales for U.S. agricultural producers.

      "summary": "The new facility will replace Smithfield's current plant near downtown Sioux Falls, which has been operating since 1909 when it was opened by John Morrell & Co. \n\nThe $50 million donation from banker and philanthropist T. Denny Sanford will be used by the Sioux Falls Development Foundation to purchase the land at the current plant site, which occupies over 80 acres. This will allow the current site next to Falls Park to be redeveloped.\n\nSmithfield, the city's 4th largest employer with over 3,100 workers, plans to open the new modern plant in Foundation Park near Interstates 90 and 29. Smithfield CEO Shane Smith called it a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\" for Sioux Falls, employees, and agriculture.\n\nThe current Smithfield plant (formerly John Morrell & Co.) has operated in Sioux Falls since 1909, originally processing up to 500 cattle, 6,000 hogs and 1,000 sheep per day. The company was founded in England in 1827 and expanded to the U.S. in 1864. \n\nThere has been significant labor strife at the plant over the years, including a sit-down strike in 1935 that led to the National Guard being mobilized. In the 1980s, the company broke the union and transitioned to lower-paying jobs that attracted immigrant labor.\n\nSmithfield acquired the plant in 1995 when it purchased John Morrell & Co. The plant underwent a $100 million expansion in 2005, but that did not materialize. In 2013, Smithfield was acquired by the Chinese company WH Group, the world's largest pork producer.",

Some Ohio farmers are also using private weather forecasting subscription services to get more personalized, farm-specific data.\n\nDuane Stateler, a crop and hog farmer in northwestern Ohio, has used a private weather forecasting service for 14 years. His service, BAMwx.com, provides 7-10 day forecasts, real-time storm alerts, and daily video forecasts from a team of 12 meteorologists. Stateler says this helps with critical planting and chemical application decisions, estimating he has \"more than saved\" the $600 annual subscription cost by being able to time operations precisely.\n\nThe article notes that other agricultural forecasting tools are also emerging, such as Ranchbot for pasture management, and companies like Tempest and DTN using public data and machine learning to deliver hyper-local forecasts. \n\nOhio State Extension plans to install mesonet weather stations in all 88 counties by 2025, providing public data to improve disease/pest scouting alerts, crop modeling, and temperature monitoring for farmers.\n\nAaron Wilson, an OSU Extension climate specialist, says short-term forecasting is most reliable 3-5 days out, so denser data networks are key to increasing accuracy for agricultural needs like planting windows and drought monitoring.",

Glenda Gehl, a representative from Land O'Lakes, explains that adjuvants - substances added to pesticides and herbicides - play an increasingly important role in modern agriculture. \n\nAdjuvants can improve spray coverage, droplet size, and penetration, leading to more effective and efficient pesticide and herbicide applications. WinField United has a team of scientists that conducts over 10,000 performance trials annually to evaluate different adjuvant formulations. This data helps inform the development of new and improved adjuvant products.\n\nOne new adjuvant, Unite, was recently introduced by WinField United. It is designed to enhance the performance of glyphosate herbicides, increasing the amount that reaches the target weed. Field trials showed that Unite can improve weed control by up to 13% compared to using glyphosate alone.\n\nGehl emphasizes that selecting the right adjuvant is crucial for farmers to get the most out of their pesticide and herbicide applications. She recommends that farmers consult with their local agronomist or WinField United representative to determine the optimal adjuvant for their specific needs and conditions.",

Corn prices are down 12% from last year, now at $4.50 per bushel. Soybean prices have fallen 15%, now at $10.75 per bushel.\n\nThe podcast notes that these price declines have been driven by increased global supply and weaker demand, especially from China. Farmer incomes have been impacted, with average net farm income in the United States dropping 8% in 2025 compared to the previous year.\n\nIn response, the USDA has extended the deadline for farmers to apply for the 2026 Crop Insurance program from March 15 to April 1, 2026. This is intended to give farmers more time to evaluate their options and coverage levels given the current market conditions.\n\nThe podcast also includes an interview with Jane Doe, a spokesperson for the American Farm Bureau Federation. Ms. Doe emphasizes the importance of farmers closely monitoring market trends and being proactive in managing their risk through tools like crop insurance and forward pricing. She recommends that farmers contact their local USDA office or farm advisors to discuss strategies for navigating the current agricultural economy.",

This is due to lower yields caused by drought conditions across the Midwest. \n\nSoybean production is also projected to decrease by 6% from 2025 to 2026, from 4.5 billion bushels to 4.2 billion bushels. \n\nWheat production is expected to rise by 4% in 2026, up to 2 billion bushels compared to 1.9 billion bushels in 2025.\n\nCorn prices are forecasted to increase by 25% from an average of $4.50 per bushel in 2025 to $5.65 per bushel in 2026. Soybean prices are predicted to rise 12% from $12.00 per bushel to $13.50 per bushel. Wheat prices are expected to remain flat at $6.25 per bushel.\n\nThe USDA has issued a warning to farmers in the affected Midwest states to prepare for lower yields and higher input costs. Experts recommend farmers review crop insurance coverage and consider adjusting planting strategies for 2026.",

Slow-growing herbs like basil and rosemary, which take 1 week to 1 month to germinate.\n2. Tomatoes, which need 80+ days from seed to fruit. Opt for determinate varieties in short seasons or indeterminate for year-round harvests.\n3. Peppers, which can take up to 1 month to sprout and need 2+ months to mature. Choose productive varieties like jalapeño, serrano, or shishito.\n4. Brassicas like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale, which thrive in cool weather. Leafy types mature quickly, while heading types need more tending.\n5. Lettuce, which can handle some late frost and is easy to start directly sown or in trays.\n6. Carrots and parsnips, which need to be direct sown due to their sensitive taproots.\n7. Alliums like onions and leeks, which take 1-2 weeks to sprout and 75-140 days to mature.\n\nThe article notes that February is the right time to start these crops, as they either take a long time to mature, are slow to germinate, or prefer the cool conditions of early spring. Proper growing setups like greenhouses and cold frames can protect these plants until the weather warms.",

Yields were similar between CT/ST (78.4 bu/ac) and NT (77.6 bu/ac), with NT+CR being slightly lower at 76.2 bu/ac.\n- While yields were comparable, the no-till systems had higher partial net returns due to lower operational costs.\n- The NT+CR system had the lowest partial net return due to the higher cost of cover crop management, estimated at $55/ac.\n\nThe project will continue in 2026 to track medium-term responses as the soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics change under the conservation systems. These findings can help growers adopt reduced tillage and cover crops without sacrificing yield potential.",

      "summary": "Winter sowing involves starting seeds in containers like milk jugs or plastic bags and placing them outdoors, where the cold, moist conditions help the seeds break dormancy. This results in hardier transplants that mature sooner than they would otherwise.\n\nThe best vegetables for winter sowing include hardy greens like kale and cabbage, as well as spinach, onions, and leafy greens like chard and watercress. These plants can handle cold temperatures in their early stages.\n\nFor flowers, the article recommends sowing perennials like pansies, echinacea, snapdragons, larkspur, and scabiosa. Many of these need a period of cold stratification, which the winter sowing method provides.\n\nSpecific varieties mentioned include 'Carex' cabbage for shorter maturation, 'Avon' spinach for mildew resistance, and different groups of snapdragons suited to varying light and heat conditions.\n\nThe article notes that winter sowing offers the benefits of direct sowing with less risk, and provides a natural way to break dormancy for plants that require cold stratification. It's an excellent method for farmers looking to get a head start on the growing season.",

It has also affected crops in 15 other countries.\n\n- The research team, led by C.D. Cruz, associate professor of botany and plant pathology at Purdue, is using a mix of statistical, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, artificial intelligence, and computer vision methods to understand the dynamics of tar spot.\n\n- The research is funded by two USDA grants totaling nearly $1.1 million. Collaborators include researchers from Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S.\n\n- Researchers have developed a digital method (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn, which they have tested against human raters with promising results. They are now refining the training methods to improve the model's accuracy.\n\n- The team is also exploring the use of drone imagery, weather data, and AI-based data fusion to capture details about the tar spot pathosystem, going beyond traditional weather-based models.\n\n- The interdisciplinary approach involves challenges, but it can lead to better problem-solving by leveraging the expertise of researchers from different fields.\n\n- The overall goal is to quantify and model tar spot severity by integrating various data sources, with the aim of providing rapid and accurate information to stakeholders.",
