The 5-4 decision concluded that IEEPA does not grant the president unilateral power to impose tariffs for national security reasons. This overturns the 25% tariff on steel and 10% tariff on aluminum that President Trump implemented in 2018, affecting key US agricultural trade partners like Canada, Mexico, and the EU. The tariffs had raised costs for US farmers and ranchers, who faced retaliatory tariffs on their exports. The ruling is a victory for the agricultural industry, which had argued the tariffs hurt their businesses.

      "summary": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs was not a legitimate use of that power. This overturns the tariffs Trump placed on various imports, including agricultural goods, under the guise of national security concerns.\n\nAccording to trade expert Jim DeLisi, the ruling means the tariffs were unlawful and farmers can now seek refunds on tariffs paid. DeLisi estimates farmers paid over $20 billion in tariffs since 2018. The decision also prevents the government from using IEEPA to unilaterally impose such tariffs in the future without congressional approval.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling stated the President cannot use IEEPA to address general economic conditions, which was the primary justification used by the Trump administration. This sets an important precedent limiting the President's ability to bypass Congress on trade policy decisions in the future.\n\nOverall, the ruling is a major win for farmers who were negatively impacted by the retaliatory tariffs imposed by trading partners like China in response to Trump's IEEPA tariffs. Experts recommend farmers seek refunds on tariffs paid and monitor for any future attempts to reinstate similar tariffs.",

      "summary": "The Fire Horse represents intense energy, rapid change, and bold movement, which is reflected in the current volatility of grain markets.\n\nEven small news, like rumors of China purchasing soybeans, can move markets quickly. Prices can swing 20-40 cents in a short time based on headlines, technical levels, and fund positioning. However, these sharp rallies often fade when the underlying fundamentals (such as export demand or supply changes) fail to materialize.\n\nThe article cautions that this volatility, while feeling bullish, does not necessarily equate to sustained improvement in the underlying math that farmers need to manage their operations. Input costs remain elevated, and farmers need to focus on incremental revenue gains (e.g. a 25-cent rally in corn on 200-bushel production equals $50 per acre) rather than chasing every market move.\n\nChina's buying patterns around the Lunar New Year holiday can also exacerbate short-term price swings. Traders position ahead of expected Chinese demand, but this can lead to misleading signals if the physical buying was already covered before the holiday.\n\nThe article recommends that farmers embrace the \"endurance\" aspect of the horse, rather than just the speed and boldness. Strategies like incremental sales into strength, defined downside protection, and maintaining flexibility are advised over trying to perfectly time the market. The goal should be improving the risk profile, not perfection.\n\nIn summary, the Year of the Fire Horse is bringing volatility and momentum to grain markets, but farmers need to manage this environment with discipline and preparation, not just reactivity, to strengthen their balance sheets.",

      "summary": "President Trump issued an executive order on February 19, 2026 directing the USDA Secretary to increase domestic production of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup. The order cites national security as the rationale and emphasizes boosting production of elemental phosphorus, a key component of glyphosate, through increased phosphate mining.\n\nThe order comes amid ongoing concerns about global supply chain disruptions and the potential impact on the availability of agricultural chemicals. Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in the U.S., with over 280 million acres of farmland treated annually.\n\nThe executive action is expected to have significant implications for farmers, who rely heavily on glyphosate-based products to control weeds and increase crop yields. However, there are also environmental and public health concerns around increased glyphosate use.\n\nThe USDA has been directed to work with the EPA and other agencies to develop a plan to ramp up domestic glyphosate production within the next 6 months. Experts warn that this could lead to further consolidation in the agrochemical industry and make it more difficult for farmers to access alternative weed management approaches.",

This is due to immigration enforcement activity scaring off migrant workers that many farms rely on.\n\n- The surge of ICE officers caused slowdowns and shutdowns at meat processing plants, which disrupted the \"just-in-time\" delivery system for hogs and turkeys that many farms depend on.\n\n- While the commissioner is relieved that the surge in enforcement is winding down, concerns remain about ongoing labor shortages, especially during the critical spring planting and fall harvest seasons.\n\n- Many farms now rely on the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program, with workers returning year after year. Farmers fear the recent enforcement will discourage these workers from coming back.\n\n- The commissioner noted that labor issues in agriculture were a problem even before the ICE operations, but the timing of the surge could have been devastating had it occurred during the busiest seasons.",

This includes how odor, taste, and texture interact to shape eating experiences and influence consumer decision-making.\n\n- Pellegrino has created models to predict odor intensity and quality from the shape of the molecule, leading to the development of a universal odor scale and a process to digitally recreate odors. These tools allow researchers to better compare sensory experiences and predict consumer responses.\n\n- Pellegrino has also contributed to projects focused on improving eating experiences for individuals who have lost their sense of smell, including developing a cookbook and exploring how other cues can enhance food enjoyment.\n\n- Pellegrino will teach ANSC 487: Sensory Evaluation of Foods starting in spring 2027, introducing students to sensory evaluation methods and their applications in research, product development, and consumer studies.\n\n- Beyond Texas A&M, Pellegrino remains active in the global sensory science community, serving in leadership roles with the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research and the International Society of Neurogastronomy.",

      "summary": "The FDA has finalized guidelines for the use of livestock antibiotics, advising drug companies to set \"duration limits\" on the length of time medically important antibiotics can be used in animal feed. However, these limits are not legally binding. The guidelines aim to curb the overuse of antibiotics in livestock, which contributes to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. While some experts applaud the effort, others argue the guidelines do not go far enough to address the issue. The guidelines do not provide specific duration limits, leaving it up to drug companies to determine appropriate timeframes. Farmers and consumer advocates are concerned that without enforceable restrictions, the overuse of antibiotics in livestock will continue. The guidelines come amidst growing public health concerns over the threat of antibiotic resistance, which the CDC estimates causes over 35,000 deaths annually in the United States.",

Clarify the farmer's ownership strategy - is this a long-term workhorse or a short-term asset? Recommend accordingly.\n\n3. Use auction data to show real-world resale performance, which reflects serviceability and familiarity more than marketing.\n\n4. Be transparent about current market conditions and timing, as that also impacts reliability.\n\nThe article recommends a \"Dealer Reliability Framework\" focused on service/uptime, ownership timeline, market conditions, and real-world resale data - rather than just promoting a brand name.

      "summary": "Key points:\n\n- Research funded by AFREC and Minnesota Soybean shows that applying 10 lbs of sulfate per acre for 4 years resulted in sulfur carryover for at least 2 more years, meeting corn's sulfur needs. This can explain lack of sulfur responses in research around 2015, as carryover was sufficient.\n\n- Soybeans do need sulfur, but direct application may not always benefit yield. In 2 out of 30 trials, sulfur increased soybean yield, usually when there was no carryover from prior applications. \n\n- Applying 20 lbs of sulfur per acre, regardless of source, ahead of corn in a corn-soybean rotation benefited both crops. Soybean benefits from sulfur applied to the prior corn crop.\n\n- For sulfate application timing, spring is best for crops with high sulfur demand like corn, alfalfa, and canola. Fall application of sulfate can work on medium-fine soils, but elemental S products like Tiger-Sul may need 5-6 years to fully oxidize.\n\n- Recommendations: Avoid immediately incorporating elemental S or S-bentonite products; allow 2+ weeks before incorporation. Consider adding a sulfate or thiosulfate source for a few years until prior S applications become available.\n\nThe research was funded by AFREC and the Minnesota Soybean Research and Promotion Council.",

      "summary": "The study conducted in Rochester, Minnesota in 2025 evaluated how spray water pH adjustment and timing of spray solution mixing affected waterhemp control in a corn herbicide program. \n\nThe treatments included a tank mix of atrazine and Acuron GT (at full or half rate) with NIS and AMS, with or without a pH-lowering and buffering adjuvant (AlpHa Shot), and mixed either six days prior to application or at the time of spraying.\n\nAdding the pH-lowering adjuvant reduced spray water pH from 7.5 to 5.8, which improved waterhemp control by 10% at 24 days after treatment (DAT) and 7% at 112 DAT. Waterhemp density decreased by 64% and biomass was reduced by 55% in treatments with the pH adjuster.\n\nThe timing of mixing the pH adjuster (6 days ahead or at time of spraying) did not affect waterhemp control, density, or biomass. The improved weed control was observed at both full and half rates of Acuron GT.\n\nThe key takeaway is that conditioning the spray water to the proper pH can improve herbicide performance and season-long waterhemp management, regardless of when the solution is mixed. Testing water pH and using a water conditioner or buffering agent is recommended if waterhemp control has been inconsistent.\n\nThe study was conducted by Eric Yu and Ryan Miller, UMN Extension Crops Educators, and was published on February 17, 2026 in the UMN Crop News.",

      "summary": "Temperatures this past week were 8-18 degrees below average, with lows reaching -7°F in Taylorville and -4°F in Jerseyville. January as a whole was about 2 degrees below normal statewide. Precipitation was scarce, with most areas receiving less than 0.1 inches of light snow. January ended around 2 inches drier than normal statewide. While some areas like Du Quoin had over 20 inches of snow, it only yielded less than 1 inch of liquid water, providing little drought relief.  \n\nLooking ahead, temperatures are expected to warm up to the 40s and 50s next week, but precipitation will remain sparse at under 0.1 inches. The third week of February is forecasted to be warmer and wetter than average as a more active weather pattern moves in. \n\nThe article also features comments from experts on the importance of using the N-Rate Calculator and Precision Conservation Management program to maximize profits rather than just yields. These tools help farmers optimize nitrogen applications to protect local water quality while maintaining their bottom line.\n\nThe article mentions the weekly WILLAg.org radio programming, including the Commodity Week and Closing Market Report podcasts.",

However, this did not translate to higher yields.\n- Soybean yields ranged from 60-95 bu/ac across trials. Yields were similar across tillage/cover crop systems, with conventional tillage and strip-till averaging 78.4 bu/ac, no-till at 77.6 bu/ac, and no-till with cereal rye at 76.2 bu/ac. \n- While yields were comparable, differences in profitability emerged due to varying input costs. No-till had the highest partial net return, followed by strip-till and conventional tillage. No-till with cereal rye had the lowest partial net return due to cover crop management costs.\n- The study will continue in 2026 to track longer-term impacts on soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics in conservation systems.",

However, high input costs (34%) and risk of lower crop/livestock prices (29%) remained the top concerns for farmers.\n\nThe Farm Financial Performance Index dropped 4 points in July to 81, 6 points lower than July 2023. This reflected farmers' worries about weakening commodity prices and high input costs. \n\nThe Farm Capital Investment Index rose 6 points to 38 in July, though it remains 7 points lower than a year prior.

Farmers are advised to scout for it.\n- Fusarium head blight (FHB) is also a concern this season, as the moderate temperatures and adequate precipitation create favorable conditions. FHB can limit yields and produce the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON or vomitoxin), which can lead to grain being discounted or rejected if levels exceed 2 ppm.\n- Farmers are encouraged to monitor for these diseases and take appropriate in-season management actions.\n\nThe article was posted on May 20, 2024 by Damon Smith, Extension Field Crops Pathologist, and Shawn Conley, Extension Soybean and Small Grains Agronomist, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
