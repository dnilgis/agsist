      "summary": "Key points:\n\n- Cattle need extra feed and shelter when temperatures drop below freezing. Even a few degrees can significantly impact their health and productivity.\n\n- Experts recommend providing at least 1 pound of extra feed per 100 lbs of body weight for every 10°F below the critical temperature of 32°F. This can amount to an additional 10-15 lbs of feed per day for a 1,200 lb cow.\n\n- Cattle need protection from wind, rain, and snow. Windbreaks, shelters, and access to dry bedding are essential. Lack of shelter can lead to reduced weight gain, milk production, and reproductive performance.\n\n- Cattle are more susceptible to cold stress in wet conditions. Dry hair coats provide much better insulation than wet, matted hair.\n\n- Pregnancy and lactation increase a cow's energy needs in cold weather. Extra attention should be paid to pregnant and nursing cows.\n\n- Severe cold can also lead to frostbite, particularly on the ears, tail, and teats. Monitoring cattle and providing treatment is important.\n\nThe article emphasizes the importance of proactive management to protect cattle during cold winter conditions for their health, productivity, and profitability on the farm.",

      "summary": "The USDA will release sterile male flies in Texas to combat the threat of the New World Screwworm, a parasitic pest that affects livestock. The release will take place in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, near the Mexico border. \n\nThe New World Screwworm is a significant threat to the livestock industry, as it can infect open wounds in animals and cause significant damage and even death. In 2016, a screwworm outbreak in the Florida Keys resulted in the deaths of 135 endangered Key deer.\n\nThe USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will oversee the release of the sterile male flies, which will compete with wild male screwworm flies to mate with female flies. This will reduce the population of the pest and help protect Texas livestock.\n\nThe USDA is investing $4.5 million in the program, which will release up to 40 million sterile flies per week over the next two years. The goal is to eliminate the New World Screwworm from the region and prevent it from spreading into the United States.\n\nExperts say the release of sterile flies is an effective method of controlling the screwworm population, as it interrupts the pest's reproduction cycle without the use of pesticides. This approach has been successfully used in other regions to eradicate the New World Screwworm.\n\nThe USDA is urging Texas livestock producers to closely monitor their animals for any signs of screwworm infestation and to report any suspected cases to their local veterinarian or the APHIS office.",

The article highlights the financial challenges faced by dairy farmers, with the average farm milk price in the U.S. being $17.50 per hundredweight (cwt) in 2022, while the cost of production is around $24 per cwt. This disparity has led many dairy farmers to depend on off-farm income to keep their farms afloat. \n\nThe article cites a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that found the median income for farm households in 2020 was $87,658, with 82% of that income coming from off-farm sources. This highlights the importance of non-farm employment for the financial viability of many dairy farms. \n\nThe article also mentions that the number of dairy farms in the U.S. has declined from over 650,000 in the 1970s to around 31,000 today, with the remaining farms becoming larger and more specialized. This consolidation has put pressure on smaller dairy farms, further emphasizing the need for off-farm income to supplement their farm earnings.\n\nThe article does not provide any specific recommendations or expert quotes, but the overall message is that the reliance on non-farm income is a crucial factor in the survival of the vast majority of U.S. dairy farms.",

      "summary": "S. government's regulations on the use of drones in agriculture. The main points are:\n\n- In 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implemented regulations that require drone operators to obtain a Part 107 commercial drone pilot license to use drones for any commercial purpose, including agriculture.\n\n- The regulations limit the weight of drones to under 55 pounds and restrict their use to visual line-of-sight operations only. Drones cannot be flown over people or beyond the operator's direct visual range.\n\n- These regulations have faced criticism from farmers and agricultural organizations, who argue that the restrictions make it difficult to use drones for beneficial applications like crop monitoring, precision spraying, and livestock management.\n\n- The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International estimates that the integration of drones into U.S. agriculture could generate over $82 billion in economic activity and create 100,000 new jobs by 2025.\n\n- However, the FAA maintains that the regulations are necessary to ensure public safety and prevent misuse of drone technology.\n\n- Some experts suggest that working with the FAA to develop more flexible regulations for agricultural drone use could be a way forward. This could involve establishing specific drone corridors or testing programs to demonstrate the benefits of agricultural drone applications.\n\nThe article highlights the ongoing tension between the desire to utilize drone technology in agriculture and the government's efforts to regulate its use for safety and security reasons. Resolving this issue could have significant economic implications for the agricultural sector.",

Soybean sales were up 18% compared to the prior year, reaching 65% of the total crop by December 2025. This aggressive selling was driven by a late-year price rally that saw soybean prices rise 22% from September to November 2025. In contrast, farmers remained reluctant to sell corn and wheat, with only 35% and 30% of those crops sold by December, respectively. Corn and wheat prices remained at multi-year lows, discouraging farmers from selling. CoBank analysts expect farmer selling of corn and wheat to increase in early 2026 as storage costs rise, but note that soybean sales may slow after the strong fall 2025 pace.",

This will give corn farmers access to a critical market, helping to offset the impact of low commodity prices and the ongoing trade dispute with China.

Though not yet present in Texas or the U.S., its northward spread from Mexico towards the southern border is a major concern.\n\n3. The disaster declaration aims to \"better equip the New World Screwworm Response Team\" by allowing them to fully utilize state government resources for prevention and response.\n\n4. Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller welcomed the declaration, stating it will give the task force greater authority, resources and speed to confront the growing threat.\n\n5. Miller urged Texas producers, especially those in border regions, to remain alert and take proactive steps like closely inspecting animals, watching for unusual behavior, and promptly treating injuries.\n\n6. Texas has been working closely with the USDA on NWS prevention and detection. In June 2025, Governor Abbott directed state agencies to enhance surveillance and response planning.\n\n7. The goal is to fully eradicate the NWS pest if it reaches Texas, protecting the state's livestock industry and wildlife.",

      "summary": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has delayed the implementation of the Horse Protection Amendments final rule, pushing the effective date to December 31, 2026. The rule was initially set to begin on February 1, 2026, but ongoing court action and Congressional direction have made moving forward impractical.\n\nThe final rule, first published in May 2024, was designed to strengthen the enforcement of the Horse Protection Act, which aims to stop the practice of soring - intentionally causing pain to horses to force an exaggerated, high-stepping gait. The key changes included a shift from an industry-led inspection system to USDA-authorized Horse Protection Inspectors.\n\nThe delay is due to three main factors:\n1. A federal district court in the Northern District of Texas vacated several key provisions of the 2024 rule in January 2025, including restrictions related to pads, action devices, and changes to the \"scar rule.\"\n2. Another lawsuit challenged existing HPA regulations and policies, including limits on noncompliant horses competing in later classes and scar rule standards, leading to a preliminary injunction in August 2025.\n3. A House Committee Report tied to the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations process directed APHIS to withdraw the 2024 final rule, further complicating the regulatory path forward.\n\nAPHIS leadership stated that implementing only the surviving pieces while major provisions remain under litigation would be unworkable for the industry and inspectors, leading to a \"patchwork\" of rules. As a result, horse show managers won't have to begin new recordkeeping and reporting requirements in February 2026, as originally planned.\n\nDeputy Administrator Bernadette Juarez said, \"Moving forward with a partial implementation while key provisions are under litigation would result in an unworkable patchwork of rules. This delay ensures that APHIS has the time to identify the most appropriate next steps to effectively end the practice of soring while providing clarity and regulatory certainty to exhibitors, managers, and owners.\"",

The SEC found that former ADM executives, including Chief Financial Officer Vikram Luthar, artificially inflated the value of the Nutrition business to make it appear more profitable than it was. This involved shifting funds from other ADM business units into Nutrition. \n\nThe SEC alleged that Luthar played a \"central role\" in the fraud, which began in 2019 before he became Nutrition's CFO. He continued the practice of improperly boosting Nutrition's performance, including through a $20 million \"rebate\" transaction in 2021. Two other ADM executives, Vincent Macciocchi and Ray Young, were also implicated.\n\nWhile ADM did not admit wrongdoing, it cooperated with the SEC investigation. The U.S. Department of Justice had been pursuing a criminal probe of the company since 2024 but ultimately dropped the case. However, an ADM investor has filed an ongoing lawsuit over the fraudulent accounting.\n\nThe Nutrition business had become a key focus for ADM, with executives touting it as the \"engine for future growth\" and tying executive bonuses to its performance. This created incentives for other ADM business units to help Nutrition meet its goals, even at their own expense.\n\nIn the wake of the scandal, ADM has taken steps to enhance its internal controls and financial reporting practices to rebuild trust with stakeholders. The company maintains it will continue operating with \"transparency and integrity.\"",

This figure represents an increase of about 10 million more wings than last year's game. \n\nIn the latest four weeks (playoff window), chicken wing units surged nationally 19.8% year-over-year, and dollars were up 11.4% versus the prior period. In the Seattle retail market, wing sales were up 8.6% in dollars, 26.3% in units, and 22.2% in volume. In the Boston market, wing sales were up 4.4% in dollars, 17.1% in units, and 10.9% in volume.\n\nRetail prices for fresh wings are down 2.8% year-over-year, with a four-week moving average of $3.47 per pound, thanks to U.S. broiler producers boosting domestic production by 2.2% in 2025. However, cold storage inventories reported to end November were at their lowest November total in more than 10 years (outside of 2020 COVID), meaning restaurants, bars, and supermarkets started stocking up well in advance of the Big Game.\n\nThe Super Bowl will take place on February 8, 2026, with the Patriots and Seahawks battling for the Lombardi Trophy. The National Chicken Council spokesperson Tom Super said, \"Football is for food, especially when it comes to the Super Bowl, where wings rule the roost. For football fans looking to add protein to their spreads at an affordable price, wings are king of Super Bowl menus.\"",

      "summary": "Bread was a staple food, often the only thing standing between settlers and starvation. Loaves were dense, hand-formed circular shapes, very different from today's commercial loaves. Two types of iron bread toasters were used in the fireplace - a \"kick toaster\" basket that rotated, and a swivel-mounted basket on a long rod. Blacksmiths often decoratively embellished these toasters.\n\nEarly coffee roasters consisted of a sheet metal cylinder with a crank, sitting on an iron base that held hot coals. Coffee roasting began in the 1500s in Africa/Middle East, and drum roasters were common in America through the 1800s. Coffee became a national obsession by the 1900s, replacing tea as the dominant drink.\n\nUnlike bread toasters, coffee roasters rarely had decorative elements. Fragile roasting cylinders often broke or rusted over time, and the bases were sometimes discarded when their original use was unrecognized.\n\nThe article provides historical context on the rise of coffee and tea consumption in America. It notes that while many pioneer cooking implements are now rare antiques, early coffee roasters are particularly hard to find today.",

In 2021, Arizona unanimously banned trail cameras for hunting, though they allow them for research, wildlife viewing, and property protection. Since then, several other states like Nevada, Alaska, Colorado, and Kansas have also introduced restrictions on the use of trail cameras during hunting seasons.\n\nThe main concerns raised are that trail cameras, especially those with live video feeds, give hunters an unfair technological advantage by allowing them to monitor animal movements and movements and ambush them, rather than relying on their own hunting skills and the animal's natural abilities to evade detection. This is seen to violate the \"Fair Chase Doctrine\" which emphasizes the development of individual hunting skills over reliance on overwhelming technology.\n\nSome specific statistics and details:\n- Trail cameras can now provide live wireless remote viewing of animal activity.\n- They are relatively inexpensive, easy to use, and readily available for various purposes like wildlife monitoring, research, farm protection, etc.\n- Delaware and Kansas have banned their use on public lands, citing issues of hunters \"staking claim\" to an area.\n- New Hampshire allows their use as long as no animal is taken the same day it is monitored.\n- The article cites concerns raised by organizations like the Pope and Young Club and Boone and Crockett Club about the use of electronic devices that can give hunters an unfair advantage over the game.\n\nIn terms of expert quotes, the article includes comments from Kurt Davis, the chairman of Arizona's Game and Fish Commission, and Daniel Pedrotti Jr., a member of Boone and Crockett's Hunter Ethics Sub-Committee, on the principles of fair chase and the line between acceptable and unacceptable technologies in hunting.\n\nThe overall recommendation is that while technology has its place in hunting, hunters need to exercise self-restraint and prioritize the development of their own skills over relying on gadgets that can give them an unfair advantage, as this goes against the core ethics and traditions of fair chase hunting.",

Their responsiveness helped preserve order flow for suppliers and continuity for customers.\n\nOn the supply side, wholesalers provided factories with clearer volume commitments and timing, allowing production schedules to remain intact despite broader market instability. On the demand side, wholesalers helped retailers maintain product availability without overextending inventory.\n\nRather than amplifying volatility, wholesalers reduced friction by making rapid commercial decisions based on real-time sell-through data. Antoshak argues that this stabilizing role becomes most visible in difficult years, when execution matters more than theory.\n\nFor farmers, the stress of 2025 revealed the value of the wholesale channel in providing stability and responsiveness during turbulent market conditions.",

Farmers can use this data to make more informed decisions about crop selection, fertilizer application, and other management practices.\n\nThe platform was developed by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) and the University of Guelph. It draws on over 100,000 soil samples collected across Ontario over the past decades. Farmers can access the GeoHub for free through the OMAFRA website.\n\nThe GeoHub aims to help farmers improve their yields and profitability by optimizing their use of inputs like fertilizer and water. It can also assist with precision farming techniques and help identify areas of the farm that may need specialized management. OMAFRA estimates the GeoHub could lead to $30 million in annual savings for Ontario farmers.\n\n\"This tool puts valuable soil data at farmers' fingertips,\" said Dr. Laura Van Eerd, a soil scientist at the University of Guelph. \"It empowers them to make better decisions that boost productivity and sustainability.\"\n\nThe Ontario Soils GeoHub is part of a broader initiative by the provincial government to support the agriculture sector.
