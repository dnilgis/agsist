The guidance is expected to save farmers thousands in unnecessary repair costs, after equipment costs rose 45% on average due to \"Bidenflation.\"\n\nThe guidance affirms farmers' lawful right to repair their equipment, rather than being forced to go to authorized dealers. This will expand consumer choice, encourage use of newer equipment, and support the EPA's mission of protecting the environment.\n\nThe action follows a June 2025 request from John Deere for EPA guidance confirming temporary emission control overrides are allowed for repairs. In August 2025, the EPA announced guidance urging manufacturers to revise DEF system software to protect farmers and other diesel equipment operators from sudden shutdowns during repairs.\n\nOverall, this EPA guidance is seen as a win for American farmers and ranchers under the Trump administration, providing regulatory relief and empowering them to fix their own equipment.",

The report shows a 1% decline in beef cows to 27.6 million head, and a smaller 2025 calf crop of 32.9 million head. \n\nCattle on feed also declined 3% to 13.8 million head. This signals continued constraints on near-term feeder supplies, which could be a tailwind for cattle prices if demand holds. \n\nThe modest increase in beef replacement heifers to 4.71 million head suggests a slow start to herd rebuilding, rather than a nationwide push. Experts say expansion is likely to be gradual, shaped more by forage conditions, replacement economics, and producer risk appetite than by headline prices.\n\nFor cow-calf operators, the tight supplies and strong calf/bred female prices reinforce the need for a long-term view on rebuilding. Stocker and feedlot operators face elevated competition for available feeder cattle, particularly in regions with good grazing.\n\nThe USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service surveyed around 35,000 operators across the country in early January 2026 to compile the report.",

Weskan Grain, a local grain elevator in western Kansas, and CXR, a regional rail consortium, are plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed on September 15, 2022.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the railroads secretly agreed not to compete for certain grain shipments, leading to higher freight rates that farmers and grain elevators must pay. Data shows that freight rates for grain shipments from western Kansas to the West Coast increased by 8-13% between 2015-2020, despite lower fuel costs. \n\nThe DOJ claims the railroads' actions violate the Sherman Antitrust Act. Union Pacific and K&O control over 70% of the rail lines used to transport grain from western Kansas to Pacific ports. The lawsuit seeks to block the railroads from continuing their alleged anti-competitive practices and recover damages.\n\nFarmers and grain elevator operators say the higher shipping costs make it harder for them to remain profitable and compete globally. They are calling for more federal oversight and enforcement to promote fair rail competition. Without relief, farmers warn that the consolidation and lack of competition in the rail industry will further squeeze their already tight profit margins.",

      "summary": "Key Points:\n\n- Extreme cold temperatures can cause trees to \"explode\" or experience a phenomenon known as \"frost cracks\".\n\n- Frost cracks occur when sudden freezing temperatures cause the water in the tree's cells to crystallize and expand, putting pressure on the wood fibers and leading the tree to split.\n\n- Frost cracks are more common on the south or southwest side of trees, where the sun warms the bark and causes partial de-acclimation.\n\n- Younger trees and trees with thin bark like maples, beech, and birch are more prone to frost cracks. Smaller trees can even split in half.\n\n- While dramatic, frost cracks are usually not a major threat to public safety, unless someone is in the woods during an event. Most trees are able to recover.\n\n- The process of \"hardening off\" and \"de-acclimating\" in trees is crucial for their survival in cold temperatures and for the flow of sap in sugar maples.\n\n- Last week, an ice storm in Nashville, Tennessee caused dozens of trees to crack and fall due to the extreme conditions.\n\n- Alistair Reynolds from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Forestry provided expert information on the science behind frost cracks.",

      "summary": "The Trump EPA has announced that farmers can now repair their own equipment emissions systems, reversing previous restrictions. This policy change will allow farmers to fix issues with emissions control systems on their agricultural machinery without needing authorization from equipment manufacturers.\n\nPrior to this decision, farmers were required to take their equipment to authorized dealers for any emissions-related repairs, which often resulted in long wait times and high costs. The new EPA rule gives farmers more flexibility and control over maintaining their equipment.\n\nThis policy shift is intended to provide relief to farmers, who have faced challenges and expenses due to restrictions on emissions system repairs. The EPA estimates that the new rule will save farmers $300-500 million per year in repair costs.\n\nThe decision was praised by the American Farm Bureau Federation, which had advocated for the change. Farmers are now able to diagnose, maintain, and repair their own emissions systems as needed, without seeking approval from manufacturers.\n\nThe policy takes effect immediately and applies nationwide. Farmers can now perform emissions-related repairs on their equipment, which should improve their ability to keep machinery running efficiently during critical planting and harvesting seasons.",

      "summary": "The grazing lease controversy in the municipal district of Ranchland, southern Alberta is reaching a critical point. The municipal council is considering ending 159 grazing leases covering over 80,000 acres of public land. This would impact 30 local ranchers who rely on these leases for their cattle operations. \n\nThe leases have been in place for decades, with some families using the same lands for over 100 years. However, the council argues the leases undervalue the land, with current rates of $1-$5 per acre. They propose increasing the rates to $10-$30 per acre. This could increase annual lease costs for affected ranchers from $80,000 to over $2.4 million.\n\nThe impacted ranchers argue the leases are vital for their operations and livelihoods. They warn that ending the leases could force many to sell off their herds and even go out of business. Community members and advocacy groups have rallied to support the ranchers, with over 5,000 people signing a petition opposing the council's plans.\n\nThe municipal council plans to make a final decision on the leases by the end of this year. Ranchers and their supporters are urging the council to reconsider and maintain the existing leasing system to preserve the region's ranching heritage and economy.",

      "summary": "Indonesia has imported 1,300 cows from Australia as part of an ambitious plan to boost its domestic dairy production. The cows were imported by the Indonesian government's dairy development program, which aims to increase the country's annual milk production from the current 1 million tons to 3.3 million tons by 2020.\n\nThe imported cows are expected to help boost milk yields, which currently average around 10 liters per cow per day in Indonesia, compared to around 25 liters per cow per day in Australia. The government is also providing subsidies and technical assistance to local dairy farmers to improve their productivity and quality.\n\nThe dairy development program is a key part of Indonesia's efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in food production and reduce its reliance on imports. Currently, Indonesia imports around 70% of its dairy products, which cost the country an estimated $1.4 billion per year.\n\nThe program has also involved the establishment of several new dairy processing facilities, as well as the training of local farmers in modern dairy farming techniques. The government has set a target of increasing the number of dairy cows in the country from the current 500,000 to 1 million by 2020.\n\nExperts have praised the government's efforts to boost the dairy sector, but have also cautioned that achieving the ambitious targets will require sustained investment and support for local farmers. They have also highlighted the need to address challenges such as the availability of high-quality animal feed and the lack of cold storage and transportation infrastructure in rural areas.",

According to Terry Kippley of the Council of Producers & Distributors of Agrotechnology (CPDA), several key changes are coming:\n\n- The EPA will evaluate all crop protection products for potential effects on endangered species and their critical habitats by 2026. This will impact over 15,000 product registrations.\n- New ESA-compliant labels with usage restrictions will be required for all affected products by 2026. Labels could prohibit use within certain distances of endangered species habitats.\n- Farmers and ag retailers will need to follow these new ESA-related label requirements when using impacted products starting in 2026.\n- Kippley recommends that ag retailers proactively engage with the EPA, CPDA, and other stakeholders to understand the upcoming changes and prepare their businesses.\n\nThe 2026 ESA compliance deadline is approaching quickly. Farmers and ag retailers should start planning now to ensure they can continue using necessary crop protection tools while following the new regulations.",

The varieties offer up to 30% higher yield potential compared to SCN-susceptible soybeans. Corteva is also expanding its SCN-resistant offerings, with 60 new SCN-resistant varieties planned for 2023.\n\nThe SCN Coalition, a public-private partnership, recommends that farmers test their fields for SCN and rotate resistant soybean varieties every year to manage the pest. Estimates show SCN is present in over 70% of U.S. soybean fields, making effective management critical.\n\nExperts emphasize the importance of an integrated approach, using resistant varieties along with other tactics like crop rotation and nematode-protectant seed treatments.

Milking Machine Selection: Portable bucket systems are recommended for herds of 10-20 cows, while pipeline systems are better suited for 20-100 cow herds.\n\n2. Milking Routine: Establish a consistent milking routine, milking at the same times each day. This reduces stress on cows and improves milk letdown.\n\n3. Udder Preparation: Properly clean and stimulate cows' udders before milking to maximize milk flow and minimize risk of mastitis.\n\n4. Milking Time: Aim to complete milking within 5-7 minutes per cow to avoid over-milking and udder damage.\n\n5. Cow Health Monitoring: Regularly monitor cows for signs of illness, lameness, or other issues. Address problems promptly to maintain herd health and productivity.\n\n6. Nutrition: Provide a balanced, high-quality diet to support cow health, milk production, and fertility.\n\n7. Facilities Upkeep: Keep milking parlors, housing, and other facilities clean and well-maintained to promote cow comfort and hygiene.\n\nBy implementing these practical tips, small and medium dairy farmers in India can improve milking efficiency, cow health, and overall farm productivity. Regular monitoring and timely interventions are key.",

      "summary": "On January 23, 2026, much of the state experienced temperatures of -20°F in the south/central regions and below -30°F in the northeast. This recent cold snap will have varying impacts on different pest insects.\n\nFor soybean aphids, the southern half of the state and Red River Valley will see very little mortality, while north-central and northeast MN will see 50-95% mortality. This means soybean aphids may be slower to build up in northern areas, but will still pose a risk requiring scouting.\n\nFor alfalfa weevil, the minimum 2-inch soil temperature of 15.4°F at the West Central Research Center suggests little mortality is expected this year. Slightly more northern areas may see slight reductions in weevil pressure.\n\nCorn rootworm forecasting is more complex, as their eggs overwinter deeper in the soil. At the Research Center, 4-inch and 8-inch soil temps only reached 19.4°F and 23.0°F respectively, so not much acute mortality is expected.\n\nFor emerald ash borer, the northern half of MN is predicted to see 25%+ mortality, which could help slow its spread. But the southern half, including the southeast and Fargo, ND, will only see around 10% mortality.\n\nThe article notes that overwintering is just one factor affecting pest populations, and scouting, resistant varieties, and other management strategies will still be important in 2026.",

This can amount to an additional 10-15 lbs of feed per day for a 1,200 lb cow.\n\n- Cattle need protection from wind, rain, and snow. Windbreaks, shelters, and access to dry bedding are essential. Lack of shelter can lead to reduced weight gain, milk production, and reproductive performance.\n\n- Cattle are more susceptible to cold stress in wet conditions. Dry hair coats provide much better insulation than wet, matted hair.\n\n- Pregnancy and lactation increase a cow's energy needs in cold weather. Extra attention should be paid to pregnant and nursing cows.\n\n- Severe cold can also lead to frostbite, particularly on the ears, tail, and teats.

The location is implied to be a ranch or farm setting where the cattle are housed.\n\nIn terms of context and causes, the article simply states that this is the cattle's first encounter with snow, without providing any additional details about the climate, weather patterns, or other factors that may have led to this snowfall.\n\nFor the impact on farmers, the article suggests that this novel experience for the cattle may be of interest or amusement to the ranchers or farmers responsible for their care and management.\n\nThe article does not provide any specific recommendations or action items for farmers. There are also no expert quotes included.\n\nOverall, the article offers a glimpse into the cattle's first experience with snow, but does not delve into any deeper insights or implications for agricultural practices or farm management.",

      "summary": "The USDA is launching the New World Screwworm Grand Challenge, a $100 million program, to combat the deadly New World screwworm parasite and prevent its spread into the United States. \n\nThe New World screwworm is a parasitic blowfly that lays eggs in animal wounds, with the larvae eating the animal's flesh and potentially killing it if not detected early. The parasite poses a serious threat to the U.S. livestock industry, as wildlife like feral hogs could bring it across the Mexican border.\n\nThe Grand Challenge aims to foster ideas that enhance sterile fly production, strengthen preparedness and response strategies, and safeguard U.S. agriculture, animal health, and trade. Eligible applicants have until February 23, 2026 to submit proposals aligning with the program's priorities.\n\nUSDA Secretary Brooke Rollins stated this is a strategic investment to ensure the safety and future success of the U.S. food supply, which is essential to national security. The goal is to utilize the latest tools and technology to combat the New World screwworm in Mexico and Central America and keep it out of the United States, helping to protect the livelihoods of ranchers and rebuild the cattle herd to lower consumer prices.",

The number of beef cows dropped 1% from a year ago to 27.6 million head, the lowest since 1961. This persistent drought in the western states has forced ranchers to slash their herds, leading to high beef prices. Beef prices will likely stay elevated for another two years as it takes time to rebuild the herd. Retail prices for ground beef reached a record $6.69 per pound in December 2025, up 19% from a year earlier. Tyson Foods is permanently closing a plant in Nebraska that employed about 3,200 workers and reducing operations at a Texas plant.

Milk cow inventories are high at 9.57 million head in late 2025, the highest since 1993.\n\n- However, replacement heifer numbers have fallen to 3.91 million head, the lowest since 1978. This indicates a weakening of the biological pipeline needed to sustain production long-term.\n\n- A key driver is the beef-on-dairy economics. Strong beef prices and premiums for beef-on-dairy calves have encouraged producers to shift breeding towards beef genetics, reducing the number of dairy-bred heifers entering the replacement pool.\n\n- Global supply growth in the U.S. and other major exporting regions has weighed on farm-level milk prices, though this has improved U.S. export competitiveness.\n\n- The concern is that milk pricing is no longer the primary signal guiding herd decisions. With supply sustained by aging cows and a thinning replacement pipeline, future supply adjustments could be faster and more volatile.\n\n- For farmers, the record milk output looks strong in the short-term, but the shrinking replacement numbers mean future supply shifts could be sharper than in past cycles.",

The cold weather has persisted, with most of northern Illinois expected to stay below freezing for the rest of January. \n\nPrecipitation has also been very dry, with January seeing less than half an inch of rain in some areas, making it the 4th and 10th driest January on record in Carbondale and Charleston, respectively. However, a major winter storm is expected to hit southern Illinois this weekend, bringing 8-12 inches of snowfall, with some isolated heavier amounts.\n\nThe article also summarizes the recent \"Commodity Week\" radio program, which featured analysis from experts Chip Nellinger of Blue Reef Agri-Marketing, Brian Stark from The Andersons, and Arlan Suderman with StoneX. The Closing Market Report is also mentioned as a daily podcast.\n\nOverall, the key points are the prolonged cold and dry conditions impacting Illinois farmers, the upcoming major winter storm, and the weekly radio programs providing agricultural market commentary and analysis.",
