EAB kills all ash trees and spreads slowly at about 0.5 miles per year.\n\nFor farmers and homeowners with ash trees, the article recommends a few options:\n- Remove ash trees and plant different species to diversify the urban forest\n- Treat ash trees with the effective insecticide emamectin benzoate, but only if EAB is found within 15 miles, as it requires repeated injections every 2-3 years\n- For areas not yet impacted by EAB, removing trees and planting new ones may be a better long-term investment than ongoing treatments\n\nThe article cautions that the decisions made today about ash trees will have impacts for decades to come, and encourages readers to plan accordingly.",

Pinney also mentioned that Ms. G is a non-releasable animal with issues preventing her from living in the wild.\n\nWhile Ms. G did not initially want to come out, she eventually explored her surroundings and saw her shadow.

The University of Tennessee is partnering with North Carolina State University and the University of Kentucky, as well as the Kentucky Center for Agriculture and Rural Development and Kentucky Dairy Development Council, to engage communities in dairy opportunities, provide leadership and educational opportunities for dairy owners and operators, develop checklists and marketing tools, and continue support for internships.\n\nEckelkamp expressed her gratitude for the continued funding, stating that it is much needed to support the dairy industry in the Southeast and ensure the availability of regionally produced dairy products.

      "summary": "U.S. soybean sales in fall 2019 were significantly higher compared to the previous year. In September and October 2019, soybean export sales reached 27.9 million metric tons, up 92% from the same period in 2018. This increase was driven by the trade truce between the U.S. and China, which led to higher soybean prices. \n\nIn contrast, corn and wheat export sales during the same period saw a decline. Corn sales fell 31% to 11.6 million metric tons, while wheat sales dropped 23% to 8.2 million metric tons.\n\nThe spike in soybean sales helped offset the impact of reduced corn and wheat exports. Overall, total U.S. grain and oilseed export sales in September and October 2019 reached 47.7 million metric tons, a 25% increase compared to the prior year.\n\nThis surge in soybean demand and prices provided a much-needed boost for U.S. farmers, who have faced several years of low commodity prices and the impacts of the U.S.-China trade dispute. Analysts expect continued strong soybean sales to China in 2020 as the two countries work to implement their \"Phase One\" trade deal.",

      "summary": "Syngenta and Ducks Unlimited have expanded their collaboration to scale regenerative agriculture practices in seed production across the Midwest. The goal is for Syngenta to grow 85% of its seed production using regenerative practices by 2030, up from the current 60%. \n\nThe collaboration will focus on increasing adoption of practices like cover cropping, reduced tillage, and diverse crop rotations on land used for Syngenta's seed production. Ducks Unlimited will provide agronomic support and help measure the environmental benefits.\n\nThe initiative will initially target 100,000 acres of seed production land in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska. Syngenta aims to enroll an additional 100,000 acres by 2025. \n\nBy adopting regenerative practices, farmers can improve soil health, increase carbon sequestration, and enhance biodiversity. This benefits both the environment and long-term agricultural productivity. Ducks Unlimited estimates the project could sequester an additional 200,000 tons of carbon annually.\n\nJason Weller, Vice President of Ducks Unlimited's Land O'Lakes Initiative, stated that \"Scaling regenerative agriculture practices on working lands is critical to addressing climate change and protecting natural resources.\"\n\nThe expanded collaboration builds on Syngenta and Ducks Unlimited's prior work together to promote cover cropping and other sustainable farming methods. This joint effort aims to further drive the adoption of regenerative agriculture across Syngenta's Midwest seed production footprint.",

      "summary": "Sugar is grown and produced from two main sources: sugar beets and sugar cane.\n\nSugar beets are root crops typically grown in colder climates like Minnesota, Idaho, North Dakota, Michigan, and Nebraska. They can weigh 3-5 pounds each, and account for about 60% of U.S. sugar production.\n\nSugar cane is a perennial grass grown in tropical climates like Florida and Louisiana. It can grow 10-20 feet tall and is harvested every 10-12 months.\n\nAfter harvest, both sugar beets and sugar cane go through similar processing. The juice is extracted, filtered, and boiled to crystallize the sugar. Sugar beets complete this process at one facility, while sugar cane goes to a sugar factory first and then a refinery.\n\nThe final product is naturally white sugar, without any additives or preservatives. Byproducts like molasses and plant residues are also utilized, minimizing waste.\n\nSugar does not have an expiration date, and is a natural product that can be part of a balanced diet. Despite sometimes being vilified, sugar plays an important role in many foods and even some medicines.",

      "summary": "This practice involves capturing water from subsurface tile drains during wet periods, storing it in a pond, and then reusing it as supplemental irrigation during droughts. \n\nThe Blairs' system was part of a pilot project with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. Building the pond was a larger investment than most conservation projects they've done, costing an estimated $2-3 million upfront plus maintenance costs. However, data from Iowa State shows there are potential yield increases from the system.\n\nAn economic analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund found that drainage water recycling can boost crop yield income by $130-$146 per acre annually, while also saving $10-$20 per acre in equipment and field costs. This practice can also provide water quality benefits by reducing nutrient runoff. \n\nThe Blairs haven't seen major yield increases yet due to timely rains, but they hope to in drier years. Chris Hay of Hay Water Solutions, who helped plan their project, says these systems work best when providing 4-6 inches of supplemental irrigation on 125 acres or more. \n\nTo get a system like this started, Hay advises understanding the scale needed and securing both private and public/outside funding. While not common yet, there is growing interest in drainage water recycling for its production and environmental benefits. The Blairs recommend seeking local expertise to design and implement these projects.",

      "summary": "The EPA has issued new guidance on February 2, 2026, clarifying that farmers and equipment owners have the legal right to repair their non-road diesel equipment. This guidance states that the Clean Air Act actually supports the right to repair, rather than limiting it.\n\nFor years, manufacturers have used the Clean Air Act's anti-tampering provisions to prevent farmers from repairing their own equipment, claiming it was prohibited. This has forced farmers to take their equipment to distant repair shops, increasing costs and downtime.\n\nThe new guidance says manufacturers can no longer cite the Clean Air Act to deny farmers and repair businesses access to the tools, software, and information needed to make repairs. This is expected to deliver significant cost savings for producers, who have faced rising equipment expenses in recent years, with an average 45% increase due to \"Bidenflation\".\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the agency is \"proud to set the record straight and protect farmers\" by affirming their right to repair. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler also expressed their support for this clarification, noting the positive impact on family farms and rural repair businesses.\n\nThe guidance also reiterates that temporary removal or disabling of emissions components during maintenance is allowed under the Clean Air Act, as long as the equipment is returned to its certified configuration before resuming operation. EPA says this will expand repair options, increase consumer choice, and encourage the continued use of newer, cleaner farm equipment while maintaining environmental protections.",

Factors contributing to the decline include drought conditions in major cattle-producing regions, high feed and input costs, and reduced profitability for cattle producers. \n\nThe lower cattle numbers may impact beef supply and prices for farmers and consumers in the year ahead. Experts recommend that cattle producers closely monitor market conditions and consider adjusting herd sizes and management practices to remain viable.",
