      "summary": "It highlights the problem of \"Wimpy promises\" where the farm parents say they will pay the child back later, but that never actually happens.\n\nThe key points are:\n- Sweat equity arises when a child earns less on the farm than they could elsewhere. Without a clear plan, promises to \"make it up later\" often get forgotten.\n- Recommend documenting the sweat equity, not just relying on verbal promises. For example, if a child makes $15,000 less per year, that could be allocated to them from the estate when transitioning the farm.\n- It's important to calculate the full compensation for each family member, including wages, benefits, housing, etc. This creates transparency.\n- Sweat equity can also come from the child's role in growing the farm's assets over time. Families should discuss how to attribute that growth.\n- Sweat equity is a complex and emotional issue in farm transition planning. The article encourages attending OSU Extension workshops to have these important conversations.\n\nThe article does not provide any specific dates, deadlines or expert quotes. It references Ohio State University Extension, the author David Marrison, and provides an example of a 55-cow dairy farm where the child earns $15,000 less per year.",

Light-exposed chicks also showed higher levels of social interaction, spending 15.1% more time in proximity to other chicks.\n\nThe study was conducted by researchers at the University of Arkansas and involved 120 broiler chicks split between light and dark incubation treatments. Chick behaviors were observed for the first 7 days after hatch.\n\nThe findings suggest that light exposure during embryonic development can influence important behavioral traits in chickens that may impact their ability to adapt to commercial production environments. Researchers recommend further investigation into the long-term effects of in ovo light exposure on chick physiology and performance.",

However, milk prices declined from $20.55/cwt in Dec 2024 to $16.93/cwt in Dec 2025. Cheese prices also decreased from $18.62/cwt to $15.86/cwt, and butter prices fell from $2.50/lb in July 2025 to $1.50/lb by Dec 2025.\n\nTexas dairy consolidation continues, with 20 dairies lost in the past 2 years (294 to 274), but cow numbers increased from 675,000 to 705,000 head. Milk production growth is expected to slow in 2026 compared to the previous 10 years, partly due to expansion in other states and water challenges in the Texas Panhandle.\n\nThe article also provides summaries of weather and crop conditions across various agricultural regions of Texas, including the need for moisture, winter wheat and pasture conditions, livestock feeding, and preparations for spring planting.",

The study was published in The Plant Cell journal.\n\nResearchers say this foundational work on the underlying cellular biology of plants is crucial to eventually developing more drought-resistant crops to help farmers. Gassmann, the director of the Bond Life Sciences Center, has spent over 25 years studying plant molecular secrets.\n\nThe goal is to better understand how to manipulate proteins like SRFR1 to improve agriculture and food production, especially in areas prone to drought.",

This is the first red potato variety developed by NDSU since Dakota Ruby was released in 2014.\n\nDakota Skarlagen was selected in 2012, evaluated from 2013 through 2025, and has been replicated in research trials and by farmers since 2017. The new variety has a deep red color that is sustained in storage, which will enhance its marketability. It is also less susceptible to silver scurf, a fungal disease that can cause potatoes to appear unattractive.\n\nThe new potato variety has smaller tubers than varieties like Red LaSota, but more of them per plant, resulting in competitive yields. It has snowy white flesh that is good for mashing, and its round shape with shallow eyes makes it easier to peel than varieties with deep eyes.\n\nSusie Thompson, NDSU associate professor and Johansen-Thompson Endowed Professor in potato breeding, believes the new variety is \"wonderful\" for both seed and commercial growers. Andy Robinson, NDSU and University of Minnesota Extension potato agronomist, also commented that the release of a new variety is good for growers in the competitive potato market.\n\nDuring the Northland Potato Growers Research Reporting Conference, potato growers also heard updates on insect management, particularly the ongoing challenge of controlling the Colorado potato beetle, which has developed resistance to various insecticides.",

      "summary": "The U.S. protein sector is facing significant challenges due to disruptions in the supply of feed-grade vitamins and amino acids. According to IFEEDER's Laura Moody and Dr. Yuan-Tia Hong, these supply chain issues are primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to production slowdowns and transportation bottlenecks.\n\nThe shortages are impacting the availability of key nutrients such as lysine, methionine, and vitamins A, D3, and E. Prices for these essential feed ingredients have increased substantially, with lysine costs up 70% and methionine costs up 100% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThese nutrient shortages are forcing livestock and poultry producers to adjust their feed formulations, leading to increased production costs. Broiler producers, for example, are facing a 10-15% increase in feed costs, while pork producers are seeing a 20-25% increase.\n\nThe impacts are being felt across the protein sector, with dairy, beef, and aquaculture producers also facing challenges in securing the necessary feed ingredients. The situation is particularly dire for smaller and medium-sized producers, who are more vulnerable to these supply chain disruptions.\n\nTo mitigate the impact, IFEEDER and industry experts are recommending that producers work closely with their nutritionists and feed suppliers to optimize their feed formulations and explore alternative ingredient sources. They also advise producers to build up their feed inventory to ensure a buffer against future supply chain disruptions.\n\nIn the long term, the industry is calling for increased investment in domestic production and supply chain resilience to reduce reliance on international sources and improve the stability of the U.S. protein sector's feed supply.",

This is due to reduced global supply and high demand from China.\n- Corn prices have also risen by 5% to $5.75 per bushel, driven by lower-than-expected yields in the Midwest.\n- The Texas Department of Agriculture announced a new $20 million grant program to help farmers and ranchers adopt precision agriculture technologies. The application deadline is April 30, 2026.\n- Industry expert Dr. Sarah Williams of Texas A&M University stated that these advanced technologies can improve yields by 12-18% while reducing input costs by 8-10%.\n- The latest USDA crop report projects a 3% decrease in overall US agricultural production this year compared to 2025, largely due to drought conditions in the Western states.\n- The report recommends that farmers in affected regions consider planting more drought-resistant crop varieties and implementing water-saving irrigation systems to mitigate the impact.",

      "summary": "Key Points:\n\n1. Harvestone Low Carbon Partners is exploring trucking carbon dioxide emissions from its Dakota Spirit ethanol plant near Jamestown, North Dakota, about 160 miles west for underground storage.\n\n2. The company requested a $20 million loan from North Dakota's Clean Sustainable Energy Authority (CSEA) in late January for its $95 million project, but the CSEA board voted against providing the funding.\n\n3. Harvestone already operates a carbon storage facility at its Blue Flint ethanol plant near Underwood, North Dakota, where the CO2 has been pumped underground into the Broom Creek Formation since 2023.\n\n4. Transporting CO2 by truck would not be a new practice, but the scale Harvestone is considering is. They plan to capture and store 230,000 metric tons of CO2 annually.\n\n5. Building a pipeline to transport Dakota Spirit's emissions would be expensive, as a 160-mile pipeline would only move about 1,430 metric tons of CO2 per mile, compared to Summit's 2,500-mile pipeline which would move about 7,200 metric tons per mile.\n\n6. Harvestone has an engineering, procurement and construction agreement with Minnesota-based McGough for the project, with a \"guaranteed substantial complete\" date in January 2027 and full commercial operations planned for later that year.\n\n7. The potential for carbon storage in eastern North Dakota is limited due to the area's geology, so some form of transportation would be needed if companies want to capture, store or use industrial emissions from the region.",

Daikon radish - Deep taproots break up compacted soil and scavenge leftover nitrogen. Requires soil temperature of at least 65°F.\n\n4. Oats - Grow quickly to prevent weed growth and form beneficial relationships with fungi. Can be sown with peas for nitrogen fixing. Tolerate temperatures down to 20°F.\n\n5. Buckwheat - A quick-maturing \"phosphorus scavenger\" that conditions poor soil. Can be used as a mulch after flowering.\n\nFarmers should consider their local climate and use low tunnels if needed to provide extra warmth and protection for the cover crops during cold weather.

With beginning stocks above 2.15 billion bushels, total supplies could exceed 18 billion bushels. Ending stocks are projected above 1.9 billion bushels, with an average farm price near $4.33 per bushel.\n\n- Soybeans: Acreage is expected to rebound to 85 million acres.

Even with higher exports, including assumed Chinese purchases, ending stocks near 370 million bushels could keep prices near $10.31 per bushel.\n\n- Wheat: Acreage is projected at 45.1 million acres, among the lowest since records began. While production may fall 4%, large carry-in stocks keep total supplies flat. The average wheat price is forecasted at $5.46 per bushel.\n\n- Sorghum: Acreage could dip to 6.5 million acres, but large beginning stocks may push total supplies up 16%.

Slow-growing herbs like basil and rosemary, which take 1 week to 1 month to germinate.\n2. Tomatoes, which need 80+ days from seed to fruit. Opt for determinate varieties in short seasons or indeterminate for year-round harvests.\n3. Peppers, which can take up to 1 month to sprout and need 2+ months to mature. Choose productive varieties like jalapeño, serrano, or shishito.\n4. Brassicas like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale, which thrive in cool weather. Leafy types mature quickly, while heading types need more tending.\n5. Lettuce, which can handle some late frost and is easy to start directly sown or in trays.\n6. Carrots and parsnips, which need to be direct sown due to their sensitive taproots.\n7. Alliums like onions and leeks, which take 1-2 weeks to sprout and 75-140 days to mature.\n\nThe article notes that February is the right time to start these crops, as they either take a long time to mature, are slow to germinate, or prefer the cool conditions of early spring. Proper growing setups like greenhouses and cold frames can protect these plants until the weather warms.",

Yields were similar between CT/ST (78.4 bu/ac) and NT (77.6 bu/ac), with NT+CR slightly lower at 76.2 bu/ac.\n- When accounting for operational costs, NT had the highest partial net return, followed by ST and CT. NT+CR had the lowest due to higher cover crop management costs, though these can be offset by cost-share programs.\n\nThe project will continue in 2026 to track medium-term soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics under the conservation systems. These findings provide preliminary evidence that soybean productivity can be maintained in reduced tillage and cover crop systems.",

      "summary": "Winter sowing involves starting seeds in containers like milk jugs or plastic bags and placing them outdoors, where the cold, moist conditions help the seeds break dormancy. This results in hardier transplants that mature sooner than they would otherwise.\n\nThe best vegetables for winter sowing include hardy greens like kale and cabbage, as well as spinach, onions, and leafy greens like chard and watercress. These plants can handle cold temperatures in their early stages.\n\nFor flowers, the article recommends sowing perennials like pansies, echinacea, snapdragons, larkspur, and scabiosa. Many of these need a period of cold stratification, which the winter sowing method provides.\n\nSpecific varieties mentioned include 'Carex' cabbage for shorter maturation, 'Avon' spinach for mildew resistance, and different groups of snapdragons suited to varying light and heat conditions.\n\nThe article notes that winter sowing offers the benefits of direct sowing with less risk, and provides a natural way to break dormancy for plants that require cold stratification. It's an excellent method for farmers looking to get a head start on the growing season.",

Cruz, associate professor of botany and plant pathology, is using a mix of statistical, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, artificial intelligence, and computer vision methods to understand the dynamics of tar spot in corn.\n\nThe research is funded by two grants totaling nearly $1.1 million from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The team is collaborating with researchers from Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S.\n\nThe researchers have developed a digital method called the stromata contouring detection algorithm (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn. They have tested the algorithm under field conditions and found it to be successful in quantifying trends, but some inaccuracies persist in fully automated scenarios. The team is now refining their training methods to improve the model's accuracy and performance.\n\nAnother research effort includes the laboratory of Purdue's Mohammad Jahanshahi, associate professor in the Lyles School of Civil and Construction Engineering and the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Jahanshahi and Cruz, along with their students, are working on a proof-of-concept data fusion project that integrates drone imagery and weather data to capture crucial details about the tar spot pathosystem.\n\nThe researchers aim to quantify and model tar spot epidemics in production-style fields using disease observations and drone-based imagery. Ultimately, the team wants to quantify and model tar spot severity by referencing and integrating imagery with spatial and temporal data.\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of the project can place greater time demands on the researchers, but it also leads to better problem-solving as each person brings their own expertise to the table.",

Maturity - Replanted soybeans will be 7-10 days later to maturity. This can impact harvest timing and drying costs.\n\n3. Weed control - Replanting provides a chance to change herbicide programs and manage weeds more effectively.\n\n4. Seed quality - Germination and vigor of replacement seed should be checked. Seed treatments may be needed.\n\n5. Planting date - Ideal replanting dates are before June 1st in northern climates. Yields drop significantly for plantings after June 15th.\n\n6. Stand uniformity - Uneven stands can impact harvestability and yield. Aim for a uniform 100,000-150,000 plants/acre.\n\nShawn P.
