      "summary": "A report commissioned by the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and Iowa Corn Growers Association predicts dire consequences for Iowa's agricultural economy if Congress does not approve year-round E15 use by 2034. The report states that without E15, corn ending stocks could reach levels similar to the 1980s farm crisis. \n\nThe report claims E15 will enable new demand drivers to support Iowa's record high corn production, but does not mention the potential environmental and health costs. Iowa currently has the 2nd highest cancer incidence rate in the U.S., which is rising while the national rate is falling. Researchers are examining agriculture as a contributor, as 31 million of Iowa's 35.7 million acres are intensively farmed.\n\nThe report also touts potential benefits of E15 like sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture/storage, but these are described as \"potential\" and face significant obstacles like lack of public support for CO2 pipelines and over $10 billion in estimated federal subsidies. \n\nThe article argues the simplest solution is for farmers to plant something other than corn, as there is no requirement to grow one crop. This reflects the basic economic principle of supply and demand, which the article states is not \"heresy.\"",

Without access to effective post-emergence tools, farmers face higher costs, reduced yields, and fewer sustainable options.\n\n- The American Soybean Association (ASA) applauds the EPA's decision and has consistently urged the agency to deliver a clear, practical, and science-based label that provides certainty for farmers and applicators.\n\n- ASA and its state affiliates submitted detailed comments to the EPA last year, emphasizing the need for greater flexibility around temperature restrictions, the importance of multiple modes of action in IPMs, and reasonable spray drift and runoff mitigation requirements.\n\n- ASA is eager to review the final label and continue engaging with the EPA to ensure regulatory decisions support both environmental stewardship and the realities of modern agriculture.",

China was the top buyer, taking 1.4 million metric tons. The strong export demand has reduced soybean supplies, with soybean stocks projected to fall to 275 million bushels by the end of the 2022/23 marketing year, the lowest in 8 years.\n\nConcerns over soybean production in Brazil and Argentina, the world's second and third largest producers, have also supported soybean prices. Brazil's crop is estimated at 152 million metric tons, down 4% from the previous year, due to drought. Argentina's crop is expected to be 49 million metric tons, down 7% from last year, also due to dry conditions.\n\nThe rally in soybean prices provides a boost for U.S. farmers, who are facing high costs for fertilizer, fuel and other inputs.

      "summary": "The poultry industry is facing significant challenges in disease management, with the recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) causing major disruptions. In 2022, over 58 million birds were affected by HPAI across 47 states, resulting in a 7% drop in U.S. egg production and a 4% decline in broiler production compared to 2021.\n\nTo address these issues, the industry is focusing on several key strategies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has allocated $51 million in funding to support HPAI response and preparedness efforts, including the development of a national HPAI vaccine bank. Additionally, the USDA is working with state partners to implement biosecurity measures and streamline response protocols.\n\nPoultry producers are also enhancing their own disease management practices. According to the National Chicken Council, 95% of broiler farms have implemented enhanced biosecurity measures, such as restricting visitor access and increasing disinfection procedures. Furthermore, the industry is exploring the use of HPAI vaccines to protect flocks, though their effectiveness and commercial availability are still being evaluated.\n\nDr. Suzanne Dougherty, a poultry veterinarian, emphasizes the importance of early detection and swift response in managing disease outbreaks. She notes that the industry has made significant strides in improving surveillance and communication, but ongoing challenges remain, particularly in addressing the economic impact on producers.\n\nAs the poultry industry navigates these complex issues, continued collaboration between regulators, researchers, and producers will be crucial in developing effective strategies to safeguard the health and productivity of the nation's poultry flocks.",

The tractor was built at the company's facility in Racine, Wisconsin and features a stars-and-stripes paint scheme designed by a local artist. \n\nThe design incorporates strategic contour lines that not only depict the land around Racine, but also relate to the data and precision farming tools used by farmers. Other subtle design elements, like the red rims on the wheels, connect the Heartland Magnum to Case IH's autonomous tractor concept from a decade ago.\n\nThis special-edition tractor will be on display at trade shows and events around the country throughout 2026, the year of America's 250th birthday. Matt Booms, a tractor product specialist with Case IH, stated that the Heartland Magnum is a \"tribute to Americana, to the hardworking men and women who use these machines, as well as to the hardworking men and women that build these machines and engineer them.\"",

This follows years of litigation with Dairy UK, the trade association for the British dairy industry, after Oatly filed their trademark application in 2019 and received registration in 2021.\n\nThe court affirmed that Oatly's trademark \"Post Milk Generation\" cannot remain valid for their oat-based products, as the term \"milk\" is legally reserved for dairy products. However, the trademark can still be used for their Class 25 products (T-shirts).\n\nThe ruling signals a strict approach to \"category borrowing\" - using regulated food terms to market alternatives that don't legally qualify. Legal experts advised plant-based producers to use clear descriptive alternatives like \"oat drink\" or \"plant-based drink\" instead.\n\nDairy UK welcomed the decision as a win for consumer protection, while Oatly criticized it as anti-competitive and benefiting \"Big Dairy\". Oatly indicated they will explore alternative ways to keep their \"Post Milk Generation\" message, such as merchandise.\n\nThe verdict follows established EU case law supporting restrictions on using dairy terms for plant-based products. It underscores the need for plant-based brands to carefully plan their marketing strategy around legally defined product names.",

Another 146 employees will return in early March to the Waterloo Tractor Operations to support 8R tractor production.\n\nThis comes after widespread layoffs in 2025, when John Deere let go of nearly 600 workers across four facilities in Iowa - Des Moines Works, Waterloo Works, Ottumwa Works, and Davenport Works.\n\nThe recalls signal improved short-term production outlooks and are a welcome boost for Iowa communities heavily tied to agricultural and construction manufacturing. Ensuring experienced workers are in place is critical as orders rebound, according to Mark Dickson, vice president of Deere's construction and forestry manufacturing operations.\n\nThe moves suggest that at least in parts of Deere's portfolio, demand is strong enough to put laid-off employees back on the factory floor - a development that will be closely watched in Iowa's ag manufacturing sector.",

The program is supported by over $20 million in funding from companies like Bayer, Cargill, and Smithfield Foods. Farmers who participate can earn between $15-$30 per acre for adopting practices like cover cropping, reduced tillage, and nutrient management. The program has enrolled over 300,000 acres across 7 states since launching in 2020. It aims to enroll 1 million acres by 2025, sequestering an estimated 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Farmers and companies are partnering to drive measurable progress in agricultural sustainability through programs like the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund.",

Daren Coppock, the CEO of the Agricultural Retailers Association (ARA), outlined how the organization is navigating these issues in Washington, D.C.\n\nARA is actively engaged in lobbying efforts to protect the interests of its members, which include over 3,000 ag retail facilities across the U.S. Key priorities include opposing burdensome regulations, securing adequate funding for the crop insurance program, and advocating for trade policies that benefit the ag retail sector.\n\nCoppock noted that the current political climate is highly polarized, making it difficult to achieve bipartisan solutions. However, ARA is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy, including building relationships with lawmakers, engaging in grassroots advocacy, and leveraging its political action committee to support pro-agriculture candidates.\n\nLooking ahead, Coppock emphasized the importance of continued vigilance and engagement in the political process. Ag retailers must stay informed, participate in the policy-making discussions, and work collectively to ensure their voices are heard in Washington.\n\nUltimately, the success of the ag retail industry depends on its ability to navigate the complex political landscape and advocate for policies that foster a thriving and sustainable agricultural sector.",

Retailers and farmers are struggling to manage these high input costs as commodity prices fall. Experts do not anticipate significant relief on fertilizer pricing in the near future, as production capacity remains limited and energy costs for manufacturers remain high.

This option allowed farmers to insure against years when weather prevents them from planting a crop.\n\nWithout this option in 2026, North Dakota farmers like Justin Quandt, who farms near Oakes, will have less protection against wet spring conditions that can leave some of their fields unplantable. Quandt's family normally invests in the additional prevented planting coverage, which requires insuring all acres in a county.\n\nThe North Dakota Farmers Union president Matt Perdue said the agency's decision is disappointing, as the recent farm bill had expanded federal crop insurance in other ways. However, an NDSU study concluded that the improvements will not outweigh the loss of the extra prevented planting coverage for North Dakota.\n\nSenators, including John Hoeven of North Dakota, have asked the USDA to undo the prevented planting changes for 2027 and beyond \"to help provide a layer of certainty when disasters beyond their control render them unable to plant a crop.\" \n\nFarmers face a March 15 deadline to make 2026 crop insurance purchases. Insurance agent Bethany Rentz hopes the USDA will bring back the extra prevented planting coverage based on pushback from other affected states.",

However, critics argue these measures are not enough to address the ongoing problems with dicamba drift.\n\nThe decision to reapprove dicamba for five more years has significant impacts for farmers.

Restoring pollinator habitat on agricultural landscapes is important, and can be done cost-effectively. Planting a diverse mix of flowering plants, even in small areas, can support a variety of bee species.\n\n4. Research shows that the amount of surrounding agricultural land or size of the habitat area does not significantly impact bee diversity and abundance, as long as there are sufficient floral resources.\n\n5. Integrating pollinator habitat into croplands can have benefits for natural pest control, and can even improve yields for self-pollinating crops like soybeans.\n\n6. Funding sources and conservation programs may be available to assist farmers in establishing and maintaining pollinator habitat.\n\n7. Minnesota alone has around 525 species of bees, ranging from tiny to large bumblebees.

This results in hardier transplants that mature sooner.\n\nThe best vegetables for winter sowing include hardy greens like kale and cabbage, as well as spinach, onions, and leafy greens. Kale, cabbage, and spinach can handle cold well even in their early stages. Onions, especially bulbing onions, benefit from the long maturation period. Leafy greens like kale, collards, and chard are also excellent choices.\n\nFor flowers, the article recommends perennials like pansies, echinacea, snapdragons, larkspur, and scabiosa. These flowers often need a period of cold stratification, which is provided by the winter sowing method.\n\nThe article provides specific variety recommendations for some of the vegetables and flowers, such as 'Carex' cabbage, 'Avon' spinach, and different types of snapdragons. It also discusses the ideal growing conditions for long-day, short-day, and intermediate-day onions.\n\nOverall, the winter sowing method allows farmers to get a head start on the growing season and produce hardier, more mature plants come spring.

Prairie Strips: Planting 10-25% of farmland in prairie strips can attract beneficial predators, improve soil nutrients, and boost yields by supporting pollinators and pest-controlling insects.\n\n2. Low Tilling: Reducing tillage and using cover crops can improve soil structure and support greater biodiversity above and below ground.\n\n3. Regenerative Grazing: Rotating livestock and using native plants, fire, and mowing can maintain healthy pastures and provide habitat for local species, especially in areas with prairie or forest ecosystems. \n\n4. Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Attracting beneficial insects through diverse plantings and cultural practices can reduce reliance on harmful pesticides.\n\n5. Conservation Easements: Partnering with land trusts to establish conservation easements can protect natural resources and provide tax benefits for farmers with large landholdings.\n\nImplementing these strategies, even partially, can have significant positive impacts on biodiversity and farm productivity by working with natural systems rather than against them. Experts emphasize that farming is as much for humans as it is a constant reminder of the laws of the natural world, and the more farmers can see their land as part of a larger ecosystem, the more sustainable their agriculture can become.",

The article recommends closely assessing fields for plant loss and patterns before deciding whether to replant.\n\nAn additional resource is provided for more information on soybean replant decisions.",
