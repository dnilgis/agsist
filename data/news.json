In the west, highs are forecasted to reach 10-15 degrees above normal, while the eastern Heartland could see highs 10-15 degrees below normal.\n\nThis weather pattern is due to a strong high-pressure system over the western U.S. and a deep trough of low pressure over the eastern U.S. Precipitation chances remain low, with only isolated snow showers expected in the eastern Heartland.\n\nThe varied temperatures will impact farmers differently across the regions. Farmers in the warmer western areas may see earlier spring field work, while those in the colder east may face delays.

      "summary": "Key points:\n\n- Corn rootworm has developed resistance to Bt corn traits in some U.S. states, threatening yields. This resistance is now emerging in Ontario.\n- In 2021, instances of corn rootworm feeding damage were reported in Bt corn fields in 4 counties in southwestern Ontario.\n- Experts recommend that farmers in affected areas rotate crops, use soil-applied insecticides, and plant non-Bt corn to manage resistance. \n- Farmers should also carefully monitor their fields for signs of rootworm damage and resistance.\n- Crop rotation is seen as the most effective long-term solution, but this may be challenging for some farmers due to market demands.\n- Experts warn that if resistance continues to spread, it could significantly impact corn yields and profitability for Ontario farmers in the coming years.",

The article cites a study by economists at Kansas State University, which found that MCOOL would result in a $215 million annual loss for the U.S. beef industry and a $360 million annual loss for the U.S. pork industry.\n\nThe article also mentions that the World Trade Organization (WTO) has ruled against MCOOL, stating that it unfairly discriminates against imported meat. This has led to the threat of retaliation from Canada and Mexico, which could further impact U.S. agricultural exports.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that the MCOOL program would ultimately benefit no one, as producers would bear the financial burden with no corresponding increase in consumer demand or willingness to pay higher prices. The article recommends that lawmakers reconsider the MCOOL program and focus on more effective strategies to support the U.S. meat and poultry industries.",

The cows were imported by the Indonesian government's dairy development program, which aims to increase the country's annual milk production from the current 1 million tons to 3.3 million tons by 2020.\n\nThe imported cows are expected to help boost milk yields, which currently average around 10 liters per cow per day in Indonesia, compared to around 25 liters per cow per day in Australia. The government is also providing subsidies and technical assistance to local dairy farmers to improve their productivity and quality.\n\nThe dairy development program is a key part of Indonesia's efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in food production and reduce its reliance on imports. Currently, Indonesia imports around 70% of its dairy products, which cost the country an estimated $1.4 billion per year.\n\nThe program has also involved the establishment of several new dairy processing facilities, as well as the training of local farmers in modern dairy farming techniques. The government has set a target of increasing the number of dairy cows in the country from the current 500,000 to 1 million by 2020.\n\nExperts have praised the government's efforts to boost the dairy sector, but have also cautioned that achieving the ambitious targets will require sustained investment and support for local farmers. They have also highlighted the need to address challenges such as the availability of high-quality animal feed and the lack of cold storage and transportation infrastructure in rural areas.",

Experts expect these trends to continue in the near future, barring any major economic or weather-related disruptions.\n\nFarmers in these regions are advised to closely monitor land values and consider opportunities to expand their operations or lock in favorable financing terms. However, they should also exercise caution and ensure any farmland purchases align with their long-term business strategies and risk tolerance.",

      "summary": "Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) remains a major threat to soybean yields, with estimated annual losses of $1.5 billion in the U.S. and Canada. To address this, seed companies are increasing their focus on SCN-resistant soybean varieties. \n\nBayer is launching a new SCN-resistant soybean line called NK S Series, with projected 2023 availability. The varieties offer up to 30% higher yield potential compared to SCN-susceptible soybeans. Corteva is also expanding its SCN-resistant offerings, with 60 new SCN-resistant varieties planned for 2023.\n\nThe SCN Coalition, a public-private partnership, recommends that farmers test their fields for SCN and rotate resistant soybean varieties every year to manage the pest. Estimates show SCN is present in over 70% of U.S. soybean fields, making effective management critical.\n\nExperts emphasize the importance of an integrated approach, using resistant varieties along with other tactics like crop rotation and nematode-protectant seed treatments. This can help slow the development of SCN populations that can overcome resistance genes.",

Milking Routine: Establish a consistent milking routine, milking at the same times each day. This reduces stress on cows and improves milk letdown.\n\n3. Udder Preparation: Properly clean and stimulate cows' udders before milking to maximize milk flow and minimize risk of mastitis.\n\n4. Milking Time: Aim to complete milking within 5-7 minutes per cow to avoid over-milking and udder damage.\n\n5. Cow Health Monitoring: Regularly monitor cows for signs of illness, lameness, or other issues. Address problems promptly to maintain herd health and productivity.\n\n6. Nutrition: Provide a balanced, high-quality diet to support cow health, milk production, and fertility.\n\n7. Facilities Upkeep: Keep milking parlors, housing, and other facilities clean and well-maintained to promote cow comfort and hygiene.\n\nBy implementing these practical tips, small and medium dairy farmers in India can improve milking efficiency, cow health, and overall farm productivity. Regular monitoring and timely interventions are key.",

      "summary": "On January 23, 2026, much of the state experienced temperatures of -20°F in the south/central regions and below -30°F in the northeast. This recent cold snap will have varying impacts on different pest insects.\n\nFor soybean aphids, the southern half of the state and Red River Valley will see very little mortality, while north-central and northeast MN will see 50-95% mortality. This means soybean aphids may be slower to build up in northern areas, but will still pose a risk requiring scouting.\n\nFor alfalfa weevil, the minimum 2-inch soil temperature of 15.4°F at the West Central Research Center suggests little mortality is expected this year. Slightly more northern areas may see slight reductions in weevil pressure.\n\nCorn rootworm forecasting is more complex, as their eggs overwinter deeper in the soil. At the Research Center, 4-inch and 8-inch soil temps only reached 19.4°F and 23.0°F respectively, so not much acute mortality is expected.\n\nFor emerald ash borer, the northern half of MN is predicted to see 25%+ mortality, which could help slow its spread. But the southern half, including the southeast and Fargo, ND, will only see around 10% mortality.\n\nThe article notes that overwintering is just one factor affecting pest populations, and scouting, resistant varieties, and other management strategies will still be important in 2026.",

This can amount to an additional 10-15 lbs of feed per day for a 1,200 lb cow.\n\n- Cattle need protection from wind, rain, and snow. Windbreaks, shelters, and access to dry bedding are essential. Lack of shelter can lead to reduced weight gain, milk production, and reproductive performance.\n\n- Cattle are more susceptible to cold stress in wet conditions. Dry hair coats provide much better insulation than wet, matted hair.\n\n- Pregnancy and lactation increase a cow's energy needs in cold weather. Extra attention should be paid to pregnant and nursing cows.\n\n- Severe cold can also lead to frostbite, particularly on the ears, tail, and teats.

      "summary": "S. government's regulations on the use of drones in agriculture. The main points are:\n\n- In 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implemented regulations that require drone operators to obtain a Part 107 commercial drone pilot license to use drones for any commercial purpose, including agriculture.\n\n- The regulations limit the weight of drones to under 55 pounds and restrict their use to visual line-of-sight operations only. Drones cannot be flown over people or beyond the operator's direct visual range.\n\n- These regulations have faced criticism from farmers and agricultural organizations, who argue that the restrictions make it difficult to use drones for beneficial applications like crop monitoring, precision spraying, and livestock management.\n\n- The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International estimates that the integration of drones into U.S. agriculture could generate over $82 billion in economic activity and create 100,000 new jobs by 2025.\n\n- However, the FAA maintains that the regulations are necessary to ensure public safety and prevent misuse of drone technology.\n\n- Some experts suggest that working with the FAA to develop more flexible regulations for agricultural drone use could be a way forward. This could involve establishing specific drone corridors or testing programs to demonstrate the benefits of agricultural drone applications.\n\nThe article highlights the ongoing tension between the desire to utilize drone technology in agriculture and the government's efforts to regulate its use for safety and security reasons. Resolving this issue could have significant economic implications for the agricultural sector.",

The parasite poses a serious threat to the U.S. livestock industry, as wildlife like feral hogs could bring it across the Mexican border.\n\nThe Grand Challenge aims to foster ideas that enhance sterile fly production, strengthen preparedness and response strategies, and safeguard U.S. agriculture, animal health, and trade. Eligible applicants have until February 23, 2026 to submit proposals aligning with the program's priorities.\n\nUSDA Secretary Brooke Rollins stated this is a strategic investment to ensure the safety and future success of the U.S. food supply, which is essential to national security.

Beef prices will likely stay elevated for another two years as it takes time to rebuild the herd. Retail prices for ground beef reached a record $6.69 per pound in December 2025, up 19% from a year earlier. Tyson Foods is permanently closing a plant in Nebraska that employed about 3,200 workers and reducing operations at a Texas plant. The high cattle prices have encouraged ranchers to sell animals for slaughter rather than keeping them for breeding.",

The rule, originally slated to begin on February 1, 2026, aimed to strengthen enforcement of the Horse Protection Act to stop the practice of soring. \n\nThe delay is due to three main factors:\n1. A federal district court in the Northern District of Texas vacated several key provisions of the 2024 rule in January 2025.\n2. Another lawsuit challenged existing HPA regulations and policies in June-August 2025, leading to a preliminary injunction that added more uncertainty.\n3. A House Committee Report in November 2025 directed APHIS to withdraw the 2024 final rule, further complicating the regulatory path forward.\n\nAPHIS leadership cited the need to avoid a confusing \"patchwork\" of rules, as implementing only the surviving pieces while major provisions remain under litigation would be unworkable for the industry and inspectors. \n\nOne tangible effect of the delay is that horse show managers won't have to begin new recordkeeping and reporting requirements in February 2026 as originally planned, providing more regulatory certainty for exhibitors, managers, and owners in the near term.",

Milk cow inventories are high at 9.57 million head in late 2025, the highest since 1993.\n\n- However, replacement heifer numbers have fallen to 3.91 million head, the lowest since 1978. This indicates a weakening of the biological pipeline needed to sustain production long-term.\n\n- A key driver is the beef-on-dairy economics. Strong beef prices and premiums for beef-on-dairy calves have encouraged producers to shift breeding towards beef genetics, reducing the number of dairy-bred heifers entering the replacement pool.\n\n- Global supply growth in the U.S. and other major exporting regions has weighed on farm-level milk prices, though this has improved U.S. export competitiveness.\n\n- The concern is that milk pricing is no longer the primary signal guiding herd decisions. With supply sustained by aging cows and a thinning replacement pipeline, future supply adjustments could be faster and more volatile.\n\n- For farmers, the record milk output looks strong in the short-term, but the shrinking replacement numbers mean future supply shifts could be sharper than in past cycles.",

The fine was related to former executives artificially inflating the value of ADM's Nutrition business, which the company had touted as a major profit driver. \n\nThe SEC found that as the Nutrition business failed to meet profit projections, ADM's former Chief Financial Officer Vikram Luthar shifted funds from other parts of the company to make Nutrition appear to be performing better. Luthar, along with two other executives, were named in the SEC complaint for their roles in the accounting fraud.\n\nWhile the SEC fined ADM, the U.S. Department of Justice dropped its criminal investigation into the company in January 2026. However, an ADM investor has an ongoing lawsuit against the company over the fraudulent accounting.\n\nADM's Nutrition business was considered a key metric for investors, with the company consistently promising 15-20% annual profit growth. This led to financial incentives for executives across the company to help the Nutrition unit meet its targets, even at the expense of other business units.\n\nThe fraud began in 2019 before Luthar's promotion to Nutrition CFO, and continued as he took a \"central role\" in shifting profits to artificially boost the unit's performance. This included retroactively locking in lower commodity prices to meet forecasts.\n\nIn 2022, Luthar was promoted to ADM's overall CFO, receiving a $130,000 bonus tied in part to Nutrition's inflated results. The SEC has filed a complaint against Luthar, while the other two implicated executives have agreed to pay back investor gains from the scheme.\n\nThe ADM case underscores the pressure agribusiness firms can face to meet investor growth expectations, and the compliance risks that can arise from aggressive financial targets and executive compensation practices.",

The current governor, Tim Walz, who is also a Democrat, announced earlier this month that he would drop his reelection campaign, amid escalating tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nKlobuchar's campaign platform includes a focus on agricultural and rural issues. She has promised to increase funding for crop insurance, expand broadband internet access in rural areas, and work to strengthen the state's dairy industry, which has faced significant challenges in recent years. \n\nKlobuchar has served as a U.S. Senator since 2007 and has developed a reputation as a pragmatic, centrist Democrat. She is expected to face a crowded field of candidates in the Democratic primary, including several state legislators and local officials.\n\nThe Minnesota gubernatorial election is scheduled for November 5, 2025. Klobuchar's announcement comes as the state's agricultural sector continues to grapple with the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and trade disputes with China.",

However, a major winter storm is expected to hit southern Illinois this weekend, bringing 8-12 inches of snowfall, with some isolated heavier amounts.\n\nThe article also summarizes the recent \"Commodity Week\" radio program, which featured analysis from experts Chip Nellinger of Blue Reef Agri-Marketing, Brian Stark from The Andersons, and Arlan Suderman with StoneX. The Closing Market Report is also mentioned as a daily podcast.\n\nOverall, the key points are the prolonged cold and dry conditions impacting Illinois farmers, the upcoming major winter storm, and the weekly radio programs providing agricultural market commentary and analysis.",
