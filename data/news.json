The service costs around $600/year but has \"more than saved\" them by helping with optimal planting windows and chemical applications. \n\nThe article notes that private agricultural forecasting tools have expanded in the last decade, using multiple forecast models and teams of professional meteorologists. These services can provide forecasts 7-10 days out compared to 2-3 days from local meteorologists.\n\nThe new Ohio mesonet stations installed by OSU Extension collect data on temperature, humidity, precipitation, soil conditions and more. This denser network of local weather monitoring aims to enable more accurate short-term forecasting, as well as innovations like disease/pest scouting alerts and growing degree-day modeling for farmers.\n\nOverall, the article highlights how both public and private hyper-local weather data is transforming farm management decisions in Ohio, from optimizing planting timing to improving pesticide and fungicide applications.",

Brown encouraged farmers to reduce land and equipment costs, noting Brazil's cost-effective equipment utilization.\n\nCrop producers are facing high input costs, with land rents, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed costs continuing to increase even during low profit margins. There has also been uncertainty around trade agreements and tariffs.\n\nBrown provided an economic outlook, projecting flat disposable income for the next few years, a gradual decline in global economic development due to increased tariffs, and slowing growth in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel without further policy changes.\n\nHowever, the specialist sees potential for improved crop prices in 2026, with USDA estimates of a 4% increase in soybean prices, 10% in corn, 13% in wheat, and 4% increases in canola, barley and cattle. This is due to increasing demand, policy changes, and the potential for smaller crops.\n\nDespite the price increases, Brown said many of these prices still may not cover the cost of production.

      "summary": "WinField United, an agriculture company, is refining spray performance through extensive testing, formulation innovation, and agronomic expertise. Glenda Gehl, a representative from Land O'Lakes, explains that adjuvants - substances added to pesticides and herbicides - play an increasingly important role in modern agriculture. \n\nAdjuvants can improve spray coverage, droplet size, and penetration, leading to more effective and efficient pesticide and herbicide applications. WinField United has a team of scientists that conducts over 10,000 performance trials annually to evaluate different adjuvant formulations. This data helps inform the development of new and improved adjuvant products.\n\nOne new adjuvant, Unite, was recently introduced by WinField United. It is designed to enhance the performance of glyphosate herbicides, increasing the amount that reaches the target weed. Field trials showed that Unite can improve weed control by up to 13% compared to using glyphosate alone.\n\nGehl emphasizes that selecting the right adjuvant is crucial for farmers to get the most out of their pesticide and herbicide applications. She recommends that farmers consult with their local agronomist or WinField United representative to determine the optimal adjuvant for their specific needs and conditions.",

She would help the children prepare, providing extra gloves and socks to make the skates fit. \n\nThe children spent time shoveling snow off the pond before skating. They would practice turns, spins, and \"Crack the Whip\" until their fingers, toes, and noses were frozen. Afterwards, they would warm up with hot chocolate and marshmallows, already planning their next trip to the pond.\n\nThe author fondly recalls the carefree joy and imagination of those winter skating days, where they felt like \"lovely skaters dressed in flowing costumes\" despite their well-worn coveralls.

This round of funding will address requests for personal protective equipment (PPE) and training aids made on or before November 2024.\n\nThe first two rounds of funding awarded $164 million for 558 fire trucks and 321 slip-on units/mobile water systems, and an additional $17.6 million for rescue equipment and dry hydrants. Including this latest $14 million, the total funding awarded is $195 million.\n\nGoing forward, the RVFDAP has also secured approximately $88 million in base funding for fiscal years 2026-27 to address ongoing equipment needs for volunteer fire departments. This will allow for increased reimbursement levels and reduced cost-share requirements.\n\nThe funds are being distributed through FireConnect, a centralized database managed by the Texas A&M Forest Service that helps fire departments access grants, report incidents, and identify mutual aid equipment during emergencies.\n\nJason Keiningham, capacity building department head for the Texas A&M Forest Service, stated that this funding has allowed them to expedite awards and address the backlog of unfunded requests, some of which have been waiting for years.",

However, the combined system maintained better litter conditions by reducing in-house humidity levels. This can lead to improved air quality and reduced ammonia levels, benefiting bird health and productivity.\n\nImplementing the combined sprinkler-evaporative cooling system could help broiler farmers manage heat stress more efficiently while reducing water consumption for cooling.

Tomatoes should be started indoors in February, especially for growers with short seasons. Determinate varieties are best for short seasons, while indeterminate varieties are good for year-round harvests.\n4. Peppers are notoriously slow to germinate and benefit from an early start in February. They can take up to a month to sprout and require a heat mat and ample light.\n5. Brassicas like broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower thrive in the cool weather of mid to late winter and early spring.\n6. Lettuce is an easy-to-grow green that can be started directly outdoors in February, as it can handle a little late frost.\n7. Carrots and parsnips should be direct-sown outdoors under row cover in February, as their deep taproots are sensitive to root disturbance.\n8. Onions and leeks should be planted in February to ensure healthy transplants when the ground warms.\n9.

      "summary": "The systems tested were: conventional tillage (CT), fall strip-tillage (ST), no-tillage (NT), and no-tillage with a cereal rye cover crop (NT+CR). Each system was paired with 3 starter fertilizer strategies: unfertilized control, 15 lb N/ac, and 15 lb N/ac + 10 lb S/ac.\n\nKey findings:\n- Starter fertilizer increased early-season soybean biomass by 12% on average, but these differences did not persist to later growth stages. Leaf nutrient levels were sufficient without starter.\n- Soybean yields ranged from 60-95 bu/ac across locations. Starter fertilizer did not significantly increase yields in any system.\n- Yields were similar across tillage systems, averaging 78.4 bu/ac for CT and ST, 77.6 bu/ac for NT, and 76.2 bu/ac for NT+CR.\n- When accounting for operational costs, NT had the highest partial net return, followed by ST and CT. NT+CR had the lowest partial net return due to higher cover crop management costs, though these could be offset by cost-share programs.\n\nThe project will continue in 2026 to track medium-term responses as the soil, residue, and nutrient dynamics change under the different conservation systems. Preliminary findings indicate soybean yields can be maintained under reduced tillage and cover crops, providing soil conservation benefits without sacrificing productivity.",

Regenerative Grazing - Using rotational grazing models, planting native species, and managing invasives can improve rangeland health and biodiversity, especially when combined with practices like silvopasture (integrating trees).\n\n4. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) - Attracting beneficial insects through diverse plantings and cultural pest control methods, rather than relying on pesticides, can protect biodiversity while still managing pests.\n\n5. Conservation Easements - Partnering with land trusts to place farmland under conservation easements can protect natural habitats and resources, while also providing landowners with tax benefits.\n\nThe article states these strategies are worthwhile, as maintaining habitat for pollinators and pest-controlling species reduces the need for costly agricultural inputs. Experts emphasize the importance of viewing the farm as part of a larger natural system, rather than isolating it. Implementing these practices can make farms more productive and sustainable in the long run.",

It has also affected crops in 15 other countries.\n\n- The research team, led by C.D. Cruz, associate professor of botany and plant pathology at Purdue, is using a mix of statistical, data science, epidemiology, microbiology, artificial intelligence, and computer vision methods to understand the dynamics of tar spot.\n\n- The research is funded by two USDA grants totaling nearly $1.1 million. Collaborators include researchers from Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S.\n\n- Researchers have developed a digital method (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn, which they have tested against human raters with promising results. They are now refining the training methods to improve the model's accuracy.\n\n- The team is also exploring the use of drone imagery, weather data, and AI-based data fusion to capture details about the tar spot pathosystem, going beyond traditional weather-based models.\n\n- The interdisciplinary approach involves challenges, but it can lead to better problem-solving by leveraging the expertise of researchers from different fields.\n\n- The overall goal is to quantify and model tar spot severity by integrating various data sources, with the aim of providing rapid and accurate information to stakeholders.",
