Rollins said this will save farmers thousands in unnecessary repairs, as Bidenflation drove up equipment costs by 45% on average.\n\nThe guidance affirms farmers' lawful right to repair, rather than rely exclusively on manufacturer-authorized dealers. This is expected to save farmers thousands of dollars by eliminating corporate middlemen. Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler said the guidance will empower farmers to fix their own equipment, breaking free from burdensome regulations.\n\nThe EPA's action does not change emission standards, but clarifies the CAA allows temporary overrides of emission control systems for repair purposes. This applies to nonroad diesel engines with advanced emission controls like selective catalytic reduction and diesel exhaust fluid systems.\n\nThe guidance was issued in response to a June 2025 request from John Deere. It aims to protect farmers, truckers, and other diesel equipment operators from sudden shutdowns, giving them time to make repairs without impacting productivity or safety.",

This is significantly lower than $1.99 per pound the same week last year, $2.65 per pound in 2024, and $3.80 per pound in 2022.\n\nThe article cites Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service economist David Anderson, who explains that while chicken wings have surged in popularity and become a cultural staple around the Super Bowl, production has kept up with demand. An estimated 17.5 billion wings will be produced this year, with 8.5% of that consumed during the Super Bowl alone.\n\nAnderson notes that the popularity of wings, like the rise of beef brisket, has transformed a once undervalued cut into one of the most sought-after and valuable poultry products. However, wing production is limited by animal physiology, with only 2 flats and 2 drumettes per chicken.\n\nOverall, football fans can expect to pay less for chicken wings this Super Bowl season compared to recent years, despite the continued high demand for this game-day favorite.",

Beef replacement heifers saw a modest increase, but the broader picture points to a slow start rather than a nationwide push into expansion. \n\nFor cow-calf operators, the tight supplies and strong calf/bred female prices mean rebuilding will take time, even if more heifers are retained. For stocker and feedlot operators, fewer calves and a smaller on-feed inventory will keep competition elevated for available feeder cattle.\n\nOverall, the data indicates expansion is likely to be slow and uneven, shaped more by factors like forage conditions, replacement economics, and producer risk appetite rather than just headline prices.",

      "summary": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued new guidance on February 2, 2026, clarifying that farmers and equipment owners have the legal right to repair their non-road diesel equipment. This guidance aims to help farmers save money on repairs, minimize downtime, and increase productivity during critical planting and harvest seasons.\n\nAccording to the EPA, the Clean Air Act actually supports the right to repair, rather than limiting it. Manufacturers can no longer cite the Clean Air Act to deny farmers and repair businesses access to the tools, software, and information needed to make repairs to their diesel engines.\n\nThe guidance applies to non-road diesel engines equipped with advanced emissions technologies, including selective catalytic reduction systems and Diesel Exhaust Fluid systems. It emphasizes that the clarification does not weaken emissions standards or change the law, but reaffirms existing statutory language that allows temporary overrides of emissions systems for the purpose of repair, as long as the equipment is returned to proper functionality.\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated, \"EPA is proud to set the record straight and protect farmers. For far too long, manufacturers have wrongly used the Clean Air Act to monopolize the repair markets, hurting our farmers.\" This action is expected to save farmers thousands in unnecessary repairs, with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins estimating a 45% average increase in equipment costs due to \"Bidenflation.\"\n\nSmall Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler also praised the guidance, noting that it will save agricultural communities thousands of dollars by eliminating corporate middlemen and empowering farmers to fix their own equipment. The lack of repair access has previously influenced equipment purchasing decisions, with some farmers opting to keep older machines without modern emissions controls that they can service themselves.\n\nThe guidance follows a June 3, 2025, request from John Deere and builds on prior EPA action in August 2025 encouraging manufacturers to revise DEF system software to prevent sudden equipment shutdowns during repairs. The EPA says this clarification will expand repair options, increase consumer choice, and encourage the continued use of newer, cleaner farm equipment while maintaining the agency's mission of protecting human health and the environment.",

The Farmers' Almanac website will remain active, providing access to archived forecasts, seasonal content, and features.\n\nPeter Geiger, longtime publisher and editor emeritus of the Farmers' Almanac, welcomed the transition and expressed confidence that Konrad will honor the publication's heritage and carry it forward for generations to come.\n\nThe Farmers' Almanac, founded in 1818 in Morristown, New Jersey, and later based in Maine, is one of America's oldest continuously published periodicals. Its content has long included weather forecasts, planting calendars, moon phases, astronomical data, fishing forecasts, home remedies, and folklore.\n\nThe new ownership plans to restore the familiar annual print edition and adapt the publication for modern audiences, while maintaining the Farmers' Almanac's online presence.",
