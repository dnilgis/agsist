      "summary": "Soybean prices held steady on Thursday despite weaker-than-expected U.S. soybean export data. According to the USDA, U.S. soybean exports for the week ending Nov. 17 reached 1.18 million metric tons, down 26% from the previous week and below trade expectations.\n\nHowever, soybeans for January delivery closed 7 cents higher at $15.02 per bushel. Corn for December delivery added 7 cents to $6.72 per bushel. Wheat for December delivery rose 10 cents to $8.08 per bushel.\n\nThe markets were focused on ongoing tight global supplies of grains and oilseeds, which continue to support prices. USDA data showed soybean ending stocks in 2022/23 are projected at just 222 million bushels, down 47% from 2021/22. Corn ending stocks are forecast at 1.182 billion bushels, down 7% year-over-year.\n\nThe lower-than-expected soybean exports could signal weaker demand, but traders seem more concerned about tight inventory levels globally. Analysts note that the market is still working to ration the tight soybean supplies.",

It is intended to provide farmers and ranchers with the legal support and protection they need to continue their operations without fear of costly and disruptive lawsuits.\n\nThe goal is to reduce the burden of \"agricultural lawfare\" on the farming community and ensure that farmers and ranchers can focus on food production without unnecessary legal challenges. This initiative is expected to have a positive impact on the agricultural sector by reducing legal costs and providing greater certainty for farmers and ranchers.",

The FDA's current standards only require access to the outdoors, without specifying a minimum time.

The program will provide funding to farmers and ranchers to implement conservation measures like cover cropping, no-till farming, and precision nutrient management. The goal is to help farmers reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build soil health.\n\nThe USDA will begin accepting applications for the program on March 1, 2026, and the deadline to apply is May 31, 2026. Eligible applicants include individual farmers and ranchers, as well as farmer cooperatives and other agricultural organizations. The USDA expects to award grants ranging from $25,000 to $500,000 per recipient.\n\nThe new grant program is part of the Biden administration's broader effort to address climate change in the agriculture sector. According to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, \"This investment will help farmers and ranchers lead the way in adopting practices that reduce emissions, increase carbon sequestration, and build resilience on their operations.\"\n\nExperts say the program could have significant impacts for farmers, helping them save money on inputs, improve soil health, and potentially earn additional income from carbon credits. Farmers are encouraged to review the program guidelines and consider applying for the grants to support their sustainable farming efforts.",

Frost heaving will create uneven soil surface and lifted plant crowns.\n\n- Damage from frost heaving can be deceptive as plants may green up initially but then die once upper soil moisture is depleted.\n\n- Identifying damaged areas early is important to plan management activities like interseeding to aid pasture recovery.\n\n- Expert quoted is Emma Matcham, assistant professor at Ohio State University's Horticulture and Crop Science Department.",

      "summary": "Tracey Coulter, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources' first-ever agroforester, received the Lifetime Achievement award at the event. \n\nAgroforestry is an ancient practice that provides benefits like shade for livestock, which can increase milk production and weight gain. Farmer Eli Mack has incorporated more trees on his 50-head beef cattle operation, Mack Farms, in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. Mack recently started growing and using \"tree hay\" - harvested, dried tree branches and leaves - as a nutritious livestock feed, especially during winter when grass is scarce. Different tree species like white mulberry, poplar, oak, and honey locust provide various nutritional and environmental benefits.\n\nWhile agroforestry was long overlooked, it is becoming more accepted today. Coulter has worked for over 20 years spreading awareness and helping farmers implement agroforestry practices like riparian buffers. Her work has protected water, built soil, and supported biodiversity. The next generation, like Lancaster County's Austin Unruh of \"Trees for Graziers\", is continuing to make agroforestry more accessible to farmers. Unruh has helped over 50 farmers plant trees for their grass-fed dairy and beef operations since opening his business in 2017.",

Iowa currently has the 2nd highest cancer incidence rate in the U.S., which is rising while the national rate is falling. Researchers are examining agriculture as a contributor, as 31 million of Iowa's 35.7 million acres are intensively farmed.\n\nThe report also touts potential benefits of E15 like sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture/storage, but these are described as \"potential\" and face significant obstacles like lack of public support for CO2 pipelines and over $10 billion in estimated federal subsidies. \n\nThe article argues the simplest solution is for farmers to plant something other than corn, as there is no requirement to grow one crop.

Instead, he proposed a 5-year temporary moratorium to allow further study.\n\nThe South Dakota Cattlemen's Association opposed the bill, fearing it could lead to other states restricting South Dakota's agricultural products. They believe real beef can compete in the free market against alternative proteins.\n\nIn 2025, South Dakota passed a law requiring clear labeling of cell-cultured protein products. The state also prohibited using any state funds for these products.\n\nWhile the banned products are not yet in grocery stores, the Cattlemen's Association believes they will likely have a limited market impact over time, similar to other alternative protein products.\n\nThe South Dakota Stockgrowers Association, which supported the original bill, disagrees with Rhoden's veto but will support the proposed 5-year moratorium.",

This represents 47% growth, far outpacing the 18% increase to the rest of the world.\n- The USMCA has generated $149 billion in total economic contribution to the U.S. economy and supported nearly 500,000 jobs and $36 billion in wages.\n- For every $1 in ag exports under USMCA, another $2.45 of economic activity was supported, contributing $64 billion to U.S. GDP and $13 billion in tax revenue.\n\nThe USMCA must undergo a formal review by July 2026 to determine whether to renew the agreement for another 16 years. Failure to renew would lead to the agreement's expiration in 2036.\n\nWhile the coalition sees USMCA as positive overall, they note issues that need to be addressed, including:\n- Canada's management of dairy tariff-rate quotas\n- Mexico not fully implementing commitments on preserving common cheese names\n- The need for clearer rules on agricultural biotech and more access for U.S. ethanol in Mexico\n\nExperts warn that without USMCA, the U.S. farm economy would face greater instability in an already challenging environment.",

      "summary": "North Dakota farmers will face greater risk this year as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency has eliminated the extra \"buy-up\" coverage option for prevented planting insurance. \n\nFrom 2010 to 2024, the extra prevented planting coverage led to $3.18 billion in payments for North Dakota producers, more than any other state. This option allowed farmers to insure against years when weather prevents them from planting a crop.\n\nWithout this option in 2026, North Dakota farmers like Justin Quandt, who farms near Oakes, will have less protection against wet spring conditions that can leave some of their fields unplantable. Quandt's family normally invests in the additional prevented planting coverage, which requires insuring all acres in a county.\n\nThe North Dakota Farmers Union president Matt Perdue said the agency's decision is disappointing, as the recent farm bill had expanded federal crop insurance in other ways. However, an NDSU study concluded that the improvements will not outweigh the loss of the extra prevented planting coverage for North Dakota.\n\nSenators, including John Hoeven of North Dakota, have asked the USDA to undo the prevented planting changes for 2027 and beyond \"to help provide a layer of certainty when disasters beyond their control render them unable to plant a crop.\" \n\nFarmers face a March 15 deadline to make 2026 crop insurance purchases. Insurance agent Bethany Rentz hopes the USDA will bring back the extra prevented planting coverage based on pushback from other affected states.",

Restoring pollinator habitat on agricultural landscapes is important, and can be done cost-effectively. Planting a diverse mix of flowering plants, even in small areas, can support a variety of bee species.\n\n4. Research shows that the amount of surrounding agricultural land or size of the habitat area does not significantly impact bee diversity and abundance, as long as there are sufficient floral resources.\n\n5. Integrating pollinator habitat into croplands can have benefits for natural pest control, and can even improve yields for self-pollinating crops like soybeans.\n\n6. Funding sources and conservation programs may be available to assist farmers in establishing and maintaining pollinator habitat.\n\n7. Minnesota alone has around 525 species of bees, ranging from tiny to large bumblebees. Native bee species, including ground-nesting bees, are the focus of research at the University of Minnesota Bee Lab.",

The results show:\n- 54% increase in readers reaching 75% of an article\n- 21% increase in readers reaching 90% of an article\n- 33% increase in daily article pageviews per mobile user\n\nThe article cites data that 79% of online users scan content rather than reading word-for-word, and most only absorb around 28% of page text. AgWeb's redesign aimed to simplify layouts and guide deeper engagement.\n\nAttention time is a better metric than CTR because it shows if users stayed with the content, scrolled with purpose, consumed multiple articles, and were in an active, focused mindset. High-attention environments deliver stronger results for advertisers, as their brand is present during engaged moments.\n\nThe improvements on AgWeb are said to directly translate to more value for brands, providing more time with content, more content consumed per session, higher quality impressions, and better alignment with how farmers search today.

Prairie Strips: Planting 10-25% of farmland in prairie strips can attract beneficial predators, improve soil nutrients, and boost yields by supporting pollinators and pest-controlling insects.\n\n2. Low Tilling: Reducing tillage and using cover crops can improve soil structure and support greater biodiversity above and below ground.\n\n3. Regenerative Grazing: Rotating livestock and using native plants, fire, and mowing can maintain healthy pastures and provide habitat for local species, especially in areas with prairie or forest ecosystems. \n\n4. Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Attracting beneficial insects through diverse plantings and cultural practices can reduce reliance on harmful pesticides.\n\n5. Conservation Easements: Partnering with land trusts to establish conservation easements can protect natural resources and provide tax benefits for farmers with large landholdings.\n\nImplementing these strategies, even partially, can have significant positive impacts on biodiversity and farm productivity by working with natural systems rather than against them. Experts emphasize that farming is as much for humans as it is a constant reminder of the laws of the natural world, and the more farmers can see their land as part of a larger ecosystem, the more sustainable their agriculture can become.",
