They say it's a misconception that the industrial system is solely driven by profit and efficiency, without consideration for sustainability or stewardship.\n\nRosenberg, an associate professor at Duke University, has expertise in rural history and the history of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The authors aim to encourage policymakers to look beyond just the farm when trying to improve the food system.\n\nThe authors define \"industrial\" food as being scalable and standardized in inputs and outputs, rather than relying on alternative methods like organic or local production. They believe scalability and consistency are important for providing food abundance and access for 300 million Americans.\n\nWhile the authors don't dismiss the value of some organic or regenerative practices, they argue that an overemphasis on these ideological labels can divert from practical, outcome-driven solutions. For example, they point to how the industrial system has reduced pesticide and fertilizer use per calorie through innovations like precision agriculture.\n\nThe key is continuing to apply smart innovations and common-sense policies to further improve the industrial food system, rather than automatically favoring small-scale, local alternatives, according to the authors.",

This is the third time the legislation has been introduced, but the first time it may not face a veto.\n\n- Key sponsors are Del. Adele McClure and Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy. Critics include Del. Wendell Walker.\n\n- Small farmers reportedly support the bill, saying they already pay over $15/hour to attract workers they depend on.

Key beneficiaries include U.S. corn and soybean farmers, who will see increased exports of 4 million metric tons and 1.5 million metric tons respectively. The deal also provides access for U.S. beef and pork, with Taiwan agreeing to lift bans on ractopamine, a feed additive used in American livestock. Additionally, the agreement streamlines regulatory processes and reduces tariffs on many U.S. farm goods. Experts estimate this trade deal could add $1 billion in annual sales for U.S. agricultural producers.

Smithfield CEO Shane Smith called it a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\" for Sioux Falls, employees, and agriculture.\n\nThe current Smithfield plant (formerly John Morrell & Co.) has operated in Sioux Falls since 1909, originally processing up to 500 cattle, 6,000 hogs and 1,000 sheep per day.

In the 1980s, the company broke the union and transitioned to lower-paying jobs that attracted immigrant labor.\n\nSmithfield acquired the plant in 1995 when it purchased John Morrell & Co. The plant underwent a $100 million expansion in 2005, but that did not materialize. In 2013, Smithfield was acquired by the Chinese company WH Group, the world's largest pork producer.",

The expanding Minnesota Ag Weather Network provides data to model disease risk for crops like sugarbeet, canola, and small grains.\n\nThe weather network also offers degree day models for pest management, insecticide timing, and crop development stages. Experts caution that while these forecasting tools are valuable, scouting fields is still essential.",

His service, BAMwx.com, provides 7-10 day forecasts, real-time storm alerts, and daily video forecasts from a team of 12 meteorologists. Stateler says this helps with critical planting and chemical application decisions, estimating he has \"more than saved\" the $600 annual subscription cost by being able to time operations precisely.\n\nThe article notes that other agricultural forecasting tools are also emerging, such as Ranchbot for pasture management, and companies like Tempest and DTN using public data and machine learning to deliver hyper-local forecasts. \n\nOhio State Extension plans to install mesonet weather stations in all 88 counties by 2025, providing public data to improve disease/pest scouting alerts, crop modeling, and temperature monitoring for farmers.\n\nAaron Wilson, an OSU Extension climate specialist, says short-term forecasting is most reliable 3-5 days out, so denser data networks are key to increasing accuracy for agricultural needs like planting windows and drought monitoring.",

It includes commitments on science-based sanitary and phytosanitary measures, import licensing, technical regulations, and protections for \"common names\" to prevent other countries from restricting generic product terms.\n\nIndustry groups like the National Milk Producers Federation, U.S. Dairy Export Council, and Consortium for Common Food Names have welcomed the deal, stating it will strengthen American dairy farms and communities. They plan to work closely with U.S. and Taiwanese officials on swift implementation.\n\nThe agreement was signed by Ambassador Jamieson Greer, representing the U.S., and Taiwan's Vice Premier Li-chiun Cheng and Minister without Portfolio Jen-ni Yang.

Collaborators include researchers from Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, South Korea, and the U.S.\n\n- Researchers have developed a digital method (SCDA) to quantify tar spot in corn, which they have tested against human raters with promising results. They are now refining the training methods to improve the model's accuracy.\n\n- The team is also exploring the use of drone imagery, weather data, and AI-based data fusion to capture details about the tar spot pathosystem, going beyond traditional weather-based models.\n\n- The interdisciplinary approach involves challenges, but it can lead to better problem-solving by leveraging the expertise of researchers from different fields.\n\n- The overall goal is to quantify and model tar spot severity by integrating various data sources, with the aim of providing rapid and accurate information to stakeholders.",

The ester and amine formulations of 2,4-D cannot be used post-emergence in Enlist E3 soybeans. \n\nWhen using a 2,4-D ester or amine formulation product for burndown applications, there is a soybean plant back interval of at least 7 days when applying 0.5 lbs ae/acre. If planting Enlist E3 soybeans, Enlist One or Enlist Duo can be applied without this plant back restriction.\n\nThe article is a reminder that the product label must be followed, as there have been reports of producers, agronomists, and crop advisors considering using unapproved 2,4-D formulations for post-emergence applications in Enlist E3 soybeans.\n\nThe article was written by Daniel H. Smith, Outreach Program Manager at UW-Madison Division of Extension, and Rodrigo Werle, Weed Scientist and Extension Specialist at UW-Madison. It was posted on May 11, 2024.",
